**Note:** When your KEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [x] **Create an issue in kubernetes/enhancements**
  When filing an enhancement tracking issue, please make sure to complete all
  fields in that template. One of the fields asks for a link to the KEP. You
  can leave that blank until this KEP is filed, and then go back to the
  enhancement and add the link.
- [x] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Copy this template into the owning SIG's directory and name it
  `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number (with no
  leading-zero padding) assigned to your enhancement above.
- [x] **Fill out as much of the kep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Title", "Authors", "Owning-sig",
  "Status", and date-related fields.
- [x] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections.
  These should be easy if you've preflighted the idea of the KEP with the
  appropriate SIG(s).
- [ ] **Create a PR for this KEP.**
  Assign it to people in the SIG who are sponsoring this process.
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the KEP clarified and merged quickly. The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

Just because a KEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved. Any KEP
marked as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing KEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

One KEP corresponds to one "feature" or "enhancement" for its whole lifecycle.
You do not need a new KEP to move from beta to GA, for example. If
new details emerge that belong in the KEP, edit the KEP. Once a feature has become
"implemented", major changes should get new KEPs.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md).

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable`, or significant changes once
it is marked `implementable`, must be approved by each of the KEP approvers.
If none of those approvers are still appropriate, then changes to that list
should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or
SIG Architecture for cross-cutting KEPs).

## Summary

<!--
This section is incredibly important for producing high-quality, user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap. It should be
possible to collect this information before implementation begins, in order to
avoid requiring implementors to split their attention between writing release
notes and implementing the feature itself. KEP editors and SIG Docs
should help to ensure that the tone and content of the `Summary` section is
useful for a wide audience.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.

Both in this section and below, follow the guidelines of the [documentation
style guide]. In particular, wrap lines to a reasonable length, to make it
easier for reviewers to cite specific portions, and to minimize diff churn on
updates.

[documentation style guide]: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/style-guide.md
-->

Kubernetes has supported volume expansion as a beta feature since v1.16. However,
this feature support is only limited to standalone pods and deployments. Expansion of 
volumes associated with a Statefulset is not supported. This enhancement proposes to add 
the ability to resize volumes associated with a StatefulSet via modifications to its specification.

Users will be able to recover from volume expansion failures using the same mechanism 
as listed in [KEP 1790](../1790-recover-resize-failure/README.md).

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this KEP.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users. The
motivation section can optionally provide links to [experience reports] to
demonstrate the interest in a KEP within the wider Kubernetes community.

[experience reports]: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports
-->

Stable persistent volumes can be created by specifying `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates`
for a [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/).
Currently, StatefulSets do not allow the associated volumes to be resized directly by modifying the
`.spec.volumeClaimTemplates`. Instead users have to modify each PVC one by one to achieve this. In such cases, 
when the statefulset scales up, the new PVC(s) will be created with the older size and this again needs 
manual intervention. The intent of this proposal is to avoid this user overhead and simplify the 
process of resizing StatefulSet volumes.

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the KEP. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

Allow users to resize the volumes associated with `StatefulSet` by modifying the size of
PVC in the `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates`.

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this KEP? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

This proposal does not try to address the following scenarios but relies on the
underlying PVC resize logic to take the appropriate action or indicate error as needed.
- Shrinking of volume is not allowed.
- Few environments require Pod restarts in order to get access to the resized volume.
- Modifying the storage class of the volumeClaimTemplate
- Resizing a PVC associated with a statefulset directly by modifying the PVC spec will not affect the 
  Statefulset `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates`. 

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?.
The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

Before we proceed to the proposal it is imperative to layout the various components involved
in creating and managing the persistent volumes associated with `StatefulSet`. 

- StatefulSet controller creates the PVCs from `volumeClaimTemplates` and associates them with the pods
spawned from it. Reconciliation logic runs for every change made to the StatefulSet
`Spec` and `Status` reflects the progress towards making the real world state equal to the
`Spec`.
- The validation logic in the API server is responsible for restricting the fields
which can be edited in a StatefulSet specification.
- The RBAC specification in the controller policy is responsible for adding the required 
RBAC permission for StatefulSet.
- The StatefulSet controller also supports revision control.

The following changes are proposed to achieve the goal:
1. Make the `volumeClaimTemplates` storage size (`.spec.resources.request.storage`) editable by modification to the api server
   validation. We should allow the user to both increase or decrease the storage size. Allowing the user to decrease the storage size will give them the ability to address failed expansions, as described in [KEP 1790](../1790-recover-resize-failure/README.md).
2. For each volumeClaimTemplate being expanded, it will be necessary to check if its associated StorageClass has `allowVolumeExpansion` enabled.
3. Add reconciliation of the associated PVC's size and the individual `volumeClaimTemplates` size into the 
   StatefulSet controller reconciliation.
4. Add PVC `patch` privilege to the StatefulSet controller's clusterrole RBAC.

Once the above changes are made, modification to any of the `volumeClaimTemplates` storage
size by user will update the underlying PVC via the reconciliation performed by (3) above.
The existing PVC resize workflow kicks in at this point and attempts to resize the volume.

### Error indications to user

Whether a resize works or not would depend on many factors such as is `allowExpansion` set in the
storage class, does the underlying storage allow expansion etc. Such failures will be reported in
the corresponding PVC events. StatefulSet would only report any failures in the update operation
performed to the PVC object.

### Revision control

StatefulSet supports [revision control](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/09/kubernetes-statefulsets-daemonsets/).
The storage size change will not be added to the fields supporting revision control. Any change in
revision - going forward to a new version or going back to an older version would not make any
changes to the persistent volume size. Any changes requiring resize of the volume will need editing
of the StatefulSet storage size specification.

### User Stories (Optional)

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this KEP is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system. The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

#### Story 1

#### Story 2

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above?
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.
-->

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed, and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed, and by whom?

Consider including folks who also work outside the SIG or subproject.
-->
Controller revision is a very useful functionality. As specified earlier in this doc, no changes will be made to the
Statefulset controller revision code. This will facilitate cases where statefulset has to roll back to a previous 
version with smaller requested storage size without the need to shrink the volume. Detailed documentation will be 
added to mitigate any user expectation mismatch.

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

### API server validation relaxation
Modifications would be made to `ValidateStatefulSetUpdate` in order to allow changes in the
storage size of the volume in the `VolumeClaimTemplates`.

### StatefulSet controller changes
The `sync` function in the `StatefulSetController` runs the reconciliation to match the current
reality and the expected declaration in the `Spec`. An addendum will be made to validate each
PVC associated with each pod and ensure that their sizes are matching VolumeClaimTemplate specification.
If the PVC's size is less than the size specified in the Statefulset's `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates`, a call will be made to update the PVC object with the size specified in the VolumeClaimTemplate. If the size of the PVC is greater than the value specified in the Statefulset's `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates`, no change will be made to the PVC in order to prevent an attempt to shrink the volume.

### RBAC changes.
Now that StatefulSet controller needs to update the PVC, `update` will be added to the `statefulset-controller` role in the buildControllerRoles.

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy. Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation, and anything particularly
challenging to test, should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

- E2E tests for volume expansion of PVC associated with statefulsets.
- Ensure statefulset controller revision works properly after resize.
- Test resize failure recovery after [KEP 1790](../1790-recover-resize-failure/README.md) has been implemented.

### Graduation Criteria

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, or as something else. The KEP
should keep this high-level with a focus on what signals will be looked at to
determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### GA

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testing—e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

#### Deprecation

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag
-->

* *Alpha* in 1.24 behind `StatefulSetVolumeExpansion` feature gate which will be set to `false` by default. Statefulset controller revision behavior will be explained in the documentation.
* *Beta* in 1.25: We are going to move this to beta with enhanced e2e and more stability improvements.
* *GA* in 1.26  

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and
  in the kubelet? How does an n-2 kubelet without this feature available behave
  when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
-->

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed and approved
for the KEP to move to `implementable` status and be included in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.
-->

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release.
-->

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

<!--
Pick one of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [ x ] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
    - Feature gate name: StatefulSetVolumeExpansion
    - Components depending on the feature gate:
      - kube-controller-manager
      - kube-apiserver, to relax the restriction on editing VolumeClaimTemplate size.

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

<!--
Any change of default behavior may be surprising to users or break existing
automations, so be extremely careful here.
-->
Yes, users will now be able to modify the requested size in the VolumeClaimsTemplate section of the statefulset spec.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

<!--
Describe the consequences on existing workloads (e.g., if this is a runtime
feature, can it break the existing applications?).

NOTE: Also set `disable-supported` to `true` or `false` in `kep.yaml`.
-->
Yes. If the feature is disabled, the user will not be able to resize PVCs associated with a statefulset anymore. Any existing statefulset reconciliation operations might be affected if feature is disabled while the volume is being resized.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?
Statefulset reconciliation process for volume size will remove any anomalies which were left behind during disabling the feature. Volumes associated with statefulsets will be allowed to resize.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

<!--
The e2e framework does not currently support enabling or disabling feature
gates. However, unit tests in each component dealing with managing data, created
with and without the feature, are necessary. At the very least, think about
conversion tests if API types are being modified.
-->
Unit tests to test behaviour of code when feature gate is enabled and disabled will be written to test both behaviors.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.
-->

- [ ] Events
    - Event Reason:
- [ ] API .status
    - Condition name:
    - Other field:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
    - Details:

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.
-->

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [ ] Metrics
    - Metric name:
    - [Optional] Aggregation method:
    - Components exposing the metric:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
    - Details:

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the following—thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->

### Scalability

<!--
For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them.

For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
Focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - Which API(s):
  - Estimated increase:
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

<!--
Look at the [existing SLIs/SLOs].

Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
(e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

<!--
Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
[supported limits].

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
-->

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

An alternative approach considered with respect to the revision control is to add the
volume size as part of the revision control. In such a case, if we did an expand
volume, users will not be able to rollback to previous versions since volume shrink
is not yet supported. Hence we take a pragmatic path and keep the volume size separate
from controller revision changes.

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG. Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, or GitHub details. Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
