## Summary

A proposal to enable pod container resource view, we get resource info in pod
is the host resource when using resource quota, with lxcfs we can will have a
right reource view in pod.

## Motivation

Java apps always abnormal run in pods with resource quota, because JVM allocate
heap memory or create GC threads based on host resources. With lxcfs feature this
issue will be solved.

### Goals

This proposal aims to the following:
- enable administrator to open lxcfs feature.
- enable pod has a nice resource view.

### Non-Goals

This feature only mount lxcfs files, the implemention of resource view is depend on [lxcfs](https://github.com/lxc/lxcfs)

## Proposal

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints [optional]

Add lxcfs volumes when mount pod volumes:
```golang
const lxcfsProcPath = "/var/lib/lxcfs/proc/"

var lxcfsProcEntry = []string{"cpuinfo", "meminfo", "diskstats", "uptime", "stat", "swaps"}

//LxcfsMounts mount lxcfs files
func LxcfsMounts() []container.Mount {
	var mounts []container.Mount
	for _, entry := range lxcfsProcEntry {
		mount := container.Mount{
			Name:           fmt.Sprintf("lxcfs-%s", entry),
			ContainerPath:  fmt.Sprintf("/proc/%s", entry),
			HostPath:       lxcfsProcPath + entry,
			ReadOnly:       true,
			SELinuxRelabel: false,
			Propagation:    runtimeapi.MountPropagation_PROPAGATION_HOST_TO_CONTAINER,
		}
		mounts = append(mounts, mount)
	}
	return mounts
}
```

Then add a feature gate, default is closed.
```golang
	if utilfeature.DefaultFeatureGate.Enabled(features.KubeletSupportLxcfs) {
		lxcfsMounts := LxcfsMounts()
		opts.Mounts = append(opts.Mounts, lxcfsMounts...)
	}
```

### Use guide

> install lxcfs 

```
wget https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/ganto/lxd/epel-7-x86_64/00486278-lxcfs/lxcfs-2.0.5-3.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm
yum install lxcfs-2.0.5-3.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm 
systemctl enable lxcfs
systemctl start lxcfs
```

> Test 

```
mkdir /root/static
touch  /root/static/pod.yaml
```

```
[root@izj6c996fvahbz1keqg2iqz ~]# cat static/pod.yaml 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: ubuntu:18.04
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 3600']
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: "500m"
      limits:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: "500m"
```

```
./kubelet --pod-manifest-path /root/static  --feature-gates KubeletSupportLxcfs=true
```

```
docker exec -it xxxx bash

root@myapp-pod-izj6c996fvahbz1keqg2iqz:/# free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           1.0G        928K        1.0G        720K          0B        1.0G
Swap:            0B          0B          0B
```
As you can see, the memory is 1.0Gï¼Œthe host memory is 4G

### Risks and Mitigations

When lxcfs restart, needs remount lxcfs files

## Graduation Criteria

### Kubelet support lxcfs

The following criteria applies to `SupportKubeletLxcfs` feature gate:

Alpha
- basic support integrated in kubelet

Beta
- ensure proper node e2e test coverage is integrated verifying cgroup settings

GA
- assuming no negative user feedback based on production experience, promote
  after 2 releases in beta.

## Implementation History

### Version 1.14

- Implement `SupportLxcfs` as Alpha.
- Graduate `SupportLxcfs` to Beta by adding node e2e test
  
### Version 1.15

- GA
