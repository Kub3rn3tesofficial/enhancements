## Release Signoff Checklist
- [ ] kubernetes/enhancements issue in release milestone, which links to KEP (this should be a link to the KEP location in kubernetes/enhancements, not the initial KEP PR)
- [ ] KEP approvers have set the KEP status to `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented
- [ ] Test plan is in place, giving consideration to SIG Architecture and SIG Testing input
- [ ] Graduation criteria is in place
- [ ] "Implementation History" section is up-to-date for milestone
- [ ] User-facing documentation has been created in [kubernetes/website], for publication to [kubernetes.io]
- [ ] Supporting documentation e.g., additional design documents, links to mailing list discussions/SIG meetings, relevant PRs/issues, release notes

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable` or significant changes once it is marked `implementable` should be approved by each of the KEP approvers. If any of those approvers is no longer appropriate than changes to that list should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or SIG-arch for cross cutting KEPs).

**Note:** This checklist is iterative and should be reviewed and updated every time this enhancement is being considered for a milestone.

## Summary

This feature allow the user to indicate if a container is critical in a Pod and define policies to escalate the container failure to the whole Pod (restart/replace).

## Motivation

In multicontainer Pods restarting a single failing container does not always recovers the pod into functioning state (eg.: in the case when a sidecar container error gets propagated to the main container it is not enough to restart only the sidecar container). In specific cases the whole Pod should be recreated.

The motivation section can optionally provide links to [experience reports][] to demonstrate the interest in a KEP within the wider Kubernetes community.

[experience reports]: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports

### Goals

This proposal aims to the following:
 - Possibility to mark one or more containers in a Pod as critical in the PodSpec
 - Replace the Pod if a critical container`s container restart count reaches a threshold. Pod replacement in this context is the process when all containers including the infra (pause) is terminated and re-created from the PodSpec

### Non-Goals

This proposal defers the following:
 - Restart all of the containers in a Pod without destroying the whole Pod (and preserving the emptyDir volumes)

## Proposal

### User Stories

1. I as an user of Kubernetes I would like to indicate the criticality of a container in the `escalations` section of the PodSpec/Container
1. I as an user would like to specify the number of container restarts which triggers a Pod replacement

An example of PodSpec/Container is provided here here:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: memory-demo
  namespace: mem-example
spec:
  containers:
  - name: memory-demo-ctr
    escalations:
      podReplaceThreshold: 3
    image: polinux/stress
```

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

- It is an open question if the whole feature can be implemented in Kubelet or other components are also affected
- The existing terminate and create procedures of the Pod donr by Kubelet should be used to implement the replacement of the Pod

### Risks and Mitigations

N/A

What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate.
Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed and by whom?
How will UX be reviewed and by whom?

Consider including folks that also work outside the SIG or subproject.

## Design Details

### Test Plan

N/A

**Note:** *Section not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy.
Anything that would count as tricky in the implementation and anything particularly challenging to test should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage expectations).
Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines] when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md

### Graduation Criteria

N/A

**Note:** *Section not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, or as something else. Initial KEP should keep
this high-level with a focus on what signals will be looked at to determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning),
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general, we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless how the functionality is accessed.

[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

#### Examples

N/A

These are generalized examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

##### Alpha -> Beta Graduation

N/A

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

##### Beta -> GA Graduation

N/A

- N examples of real world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testing e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least 2 releases between beta and GA/stable, since there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports, in back-to-back releases.

##### Removing a deprecated flag

N/A

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality which deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include [conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/conformance-tests.md

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

N/A

If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing cluster required to make on upgrade in order to keep previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing cluster required to make on upgrade in order to make use of the enhancement?

### Version Skew Strategy

N/A

If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other components? What are the guarantees? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and in the kubelet? How does an n-2 kubelet without this feature available behave when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI, CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.

## Implementation History

N/A

Major milestones in the life cycle of a KEP should be tracked in `Implementation History`.
Major milestones might include

- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded

## Drawbacks [optional]

N/A

Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented.

## Alternatives [optional]

N/A

Similar to the `Drawbacks` section the `Alternatives` section is used to highlight and record other possible approaches to delivering the value proposed by a KEP.

## Infrastructure Needed [optional]

N/A

Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG.
Examples include a new subproject, repos requested, github details.
Listing these here allows a SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
