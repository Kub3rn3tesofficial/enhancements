## Summary

This KEP proposes the addition of a new sleep action for the PreStop lifecycle hook in Kubernetes, allowing containers to pause for a specified duration before termination. This enhancement aims to provide a more straightforward way to manage graceful shutdowns and improve the overall lifecycle management of containers.

## Motivation

Currently, Kubernetes supports two types of actions for PreStop hooks: exec and httpGet. Although these actions offer flexibility, they often require additional scripting or custom solutions to achieve a simple sleep functionality. A built-in sleep action would provide a more user-friendly and native solution for scenarios where a container needs to pause before shutting down, such as:

- Ensuring that the container gracefully releases resources and connections.
- Allowing a smooth transition in load balancers or service meshes.
- Providing a buffer period for external monitoring and alerting systems.

### Goals

- Allow containers to perform cleanup or shutdown actions before being terminated, by sleeping for a specified duration in the preStop hook.
- Improve the overall reliability and availability of Kubernetes applications by providing a way for containers to gracefully terminate.

### Non-Goals

- This KEP does not aim to replace other Kubernetes features that can be used to perform cleanup actions, such as init containers or sidecar containers.
- This KEP does not aim to provide a way to pause or delay pod termination indefinitely.

## Proposal

We propose adding a new sleep action for the PreStop hook, which will pause the container for a specified duration before termination. The API changes will include the following:

- Extending the LifecycleHandler object to support a new Sleep field.
- Adding a SleepAction object that includes a Duration field to specify the sleep period in seconds.

### User Stories (Optional)

#### Story 1
As a Kubernetes user, I want to configure my container to sleep for a specific duration before termination so that it can gracefully release resources and connections.

#### Story 2
As a Kubernetes user, I want to configure my container to sleep before termination to ensure a smooth transition in my service mesh or load balancer.

#### Story 3
As a Kubernetes user, I want to configure my container to sleep before termination to provide a buffer period for external monitoring and alerting systems.

### Risks and Mitigations

One potential risk of adding a sleep action to the preStop hook is that it may increase the time it takes for a pod to terminate, which can affect the overall availability of the application.
To mitigate this risk, users will be encouraged to specify a reasonable duration for the sleep action that allows the container to perform any necessary cleanup actions without significantly delaying pod termination. It's recommended that users set the duration to a value that is less than or equal to the terminationGracePeriodSeconds specified in the pod's spec. Additionally, users should be aware that setting a duration that is too long may cause the pod to fail during rolling updates or during eviction due to node failures. Documentation and examples will be provided to help users understand how to use the sleep action effectively and avoid potential issues.

## Design Details

### Implementation

- Adding a SleepAction object that includes a Duration field to specify the sleep period in seconds.
```go
type SleepAction struct {
	// Seconds is the number of seconds to sleep. 
	Seconds int32
}
```

-  Adding a Sleep field to the LifecycleHandler struct, which represents the duration in seconds that the container should sleep before being terminated during the preStop hook.
```go
type LifecycleHandler struct {
	// Sleep pauses further lifecycle progress for a defined time period.
	Sleep *SleepAction
}
```

- When Kubernetes executes the preStop hook with sleep action, it'll simply sleep for a specific seconds.
```go
func (hr *handlerRunner) Run(ctx context.Context, containerID kubecontainer.ContainerID, pod *v1.Pod, container *v1.Container, handler *v1.LifecycleHandler) (string, error) {
    switch {
    case handler.Exec != nil:...
    case handler.HTTPGet != nil:...
    case handler.Sleep != nil:
        hr.runSleepHandler(ctx, handler.Sleep.Seconds)
        return "", nil
    default:...
    }
}

func (hr *handlerRunner) runSleepHandler(ctx context.Context, seconds int32) {
        time.Sleep(time.Duration(seconds) * time.Second)
}
```
### Test Plan

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

##### Unit tests

- Test that the runSleepHandler function sleeps for the correct duration when given a valid duration value.
- Test that the runSleepHandler function returns without error when given a valid duration value.
- Test that the validation returns an error when given an invalid duration value (e.g., a negative value).
- Test that the runSleepHandler function returns immediately when given a duration of zero.

##### Integration tests
N/A

##### e2e tests
- Basic functionality
  1. Create a simple pod with a container that runs a long-running process.
  2. Add a preStop hook to the container configuration, using the new sleepAction with a specified sleep duration (e.g., 5 seconds).
  3. Delete the pod and observe the time it takes for the container to terminate.
  4. Verify that the container sleeps for the specified duration before it is terminated.

- Sleep duration boundary testing
  1. Create a simple pod with a container that runs a long-running process.
  2. Add a preStop hook to the container configuration, using the new sleepAction with various sleep durations, including:0 seconds (minimum allowed value), values slightly above the minimum allowed value (to test edge cases).
  3. For each sleep duration, delete the pod and observe the time it takes for the container to terminate.
  4. Verify that the container sleeps for the specified duration before it is terminated.

- Interaction with termination grace period
  1. Create a simple pod with a container that runs a long-running process.
  2. Add a preStop hook to the container configuration, using the new sleepAction with a specified sleep duration (e.g., 5 seconds).
  3. Set the termination grace period to various values, including:
     - Less than the sleep duration
     - Equal to the sleep duration
     - Greater than the sleep duration
  4. For each termination grace period value, delete the pod and observe the time it takes for the container to terminate.
  5. Verify that the container is terminated gracefully after the configured sleep duration.

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial unit/integration tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Additional e2e tests are completed

#### GA

- No negative feedback
- No bug issues reported

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

#### Upgrade
The previous PreStop behavior will not be broken. Users can continue to use their hooks as it is.
To use this enhancement, users need to enable the feature gate, and add sleep action in their prestop hook.

#### Downgrade
Kube-apiserver will ignore sleep in prestop hook.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: PodLifecycleSleepAction
  - Components depending on the feature gate: kubelet,kube-apiserver
- [ ] Other
  - Describe the mechanism:
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
    plane?
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
    of a node?

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

The feature can be disabled in Alpha and Beta versions by restarting kube-apiserver with the feature-gate off. In terms of Stable versions, users can choose to opt-out by not setting the sleep field.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

New pods with sleep action in prestop hook can be created.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

No

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

The change is opt-in, it doesn't impact already running workloads. But problems with the updated validation logic may cause crashes in the apiserver.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

N/A

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

Test manually

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

Yes

### Monitoring Requirements

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

Inspect the prestop hook configuration

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason: 
- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name: 
  - Other field: 
- [x] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details: Check the logs of the container during termination, check the termination duration.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

N/A

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

- [ ] Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [x] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details: Check the logs of the container during termination, check the termination duration.

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

N/A

### Dependencies

N/A

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

No

### Scalability

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

No

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

No

### Troubleshooting

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?
- In general, if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable, Kubernetes will be unable to coordinate container termination and the preStop hook may not be executed at all. This could result in the container being terminated abruptly without the opportunity to perform any necessary cleanup actions.

- If the sleep action is enabled for the preStop hook, it will still attempt to sleep for the specified duration before the container is terminated. However, if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable, Kubernetes may be unable to send the SIGTERM signal to the container, which could cause the container to continue running beyond the specified sleep period.

###### What are other known failure modes?

N/A

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?
