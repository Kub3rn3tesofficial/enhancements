## Summary



## Motivation

Kubernetes needs to be rewritten in bash because bash is a powerful, reliable, and widely-used scripting language and it provides a consistent way of automating tasks across different platforms. It also allows for more flexibility in deploying and managing containers. Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containerized applications, and being able to leverage the power of bash scripting to customize and automate tasks makes it even more powerful.

First, bash is a very powerful and versatile language, and it can be used to accomplish a wide range of tasks. This makes it a good choice for rewriting Kubernetes, which is a complex system with many different components.

Second, bash is a relatively easy language to learn, which means that it could be used to rewrite Kubernetes by a team of developers with a variety of skill levels.

Third, bash is a widely-used language, which means that there is a large community of developers who are familiar with it. This could make it easier to find developers who are willing to work on rewriting Kubernetes in bash.


### Goals

The goals of rewriting Kubernetes in bash are to create a simple, lightweight, and more accessible version of the popular container orchestration platform that is easier to install and use. This could help make Kubernetes more accessible to users who are not as familiar with more complex container orchestration technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes. Additionally, it could help reduce the cost of running Kubernetes as the shell script can be deployed more quickly and with fewer resources.

### Non-Goals

Non-goals of rewriting Kubernetes in bash include providing a fully featured version of Kubernetes, as it is likely to be missing features and functionality that are available in the full version. Additionally, it is unlikely that the rewritten version of Kubernetes will be as secure or performant as the full version. Finally, it is unlikely that the rewritten version of Kubernetes will be as well supported as the full version, making it more difficult to get help with issues or troubleshoot.

## Proposal

The proposal to rewrite Kubernetes in bash would involve breaking down the various components of Kubernetes and creating individual shell scripts for each of them. This would include scripts for the API server, scheduler, etcd, and other core components as well as scripts for any additional components such as networking and storage. Each of these scripts would be written in bash and would be designed to be as simple and lightweight as possible. 

Once the individual scripts are written, they would need to be combined into a single script that would act as an entry point and execute the various components in the correct order. This script would also need to include error handling logic to ensure that the components are started in the correct order and that any errors are handled gracefully.

Finally, the script would need to be packaged up in a container image and made available in a public container registry. This would allow users to easily install and use the rewritten version of Kubernetes.

Overall, rewriting Kubernetes in bash would involve breaking down the core components into individual scripts, combining them into a single script, and packaging them into a container image. This would create a simplified, lightweight version of Kubernetes that is easier to install and use


### Risks and Mitigations

1. Security: Rewriting Kubernetes in bash would leave it vulnerable to malicious attacks that are specifically tailored to this scripting language.

Mitigation: Implementing additional security measures, such as adding authentication, encryption, and access control, can help protect against malicious attacks.

2. Performance: Rewriting Kubernetes in bash would likely cause performance degradation due to the complexity of the code and the lack of built-in optimizations.

Mitigation: Utilizing additional scripting languages, such as Python or Go, would provide the necessary optimizations and performance improvements.

3. Scalability: Kubernetes is designed to be easily scalable. Rewriting it in bash would make it much more difficult to scale due to its limited capabilities.

Mitigation: Implementing additional programming languages or frameworks, such as Python or Kubernetes Operators, can help increase scalability.

## Design Details



### Test Plan

##### Prerequisite testing updates

Rewriting Kubernetes in Bash would be a significant undertaking and would require careful consideration of a number of design details. Here are some potential design details that would need to be considered:

- Modularization: Kubernetes is a complex system with many different components, so it would be important to break it down into smaller, more manageable modules that can be written and tested independently. This could involve creating a series of Bash scripts, each of which is responsible for a specific part of the Kubernetes system.

- Error handling: Bash is a powerful scripting language, but it's also known for its tricky error handling. When rewriting Kubernetes in Bash, it would be important to carefully handle errors and ensure that the system remains stable and reliable.

- Performance: As mentioned earlier, Bash is an interpreted language and may not provide the same level of performance as a compiled language like Go. To address this, the Bash scripts could be optimized for performance, and additional tools or techniques could be used to improve overall system performance.

- Compatibility: Rewriting Kubernetes in Bash could potentially break compatibility with existing installations of Kubernetes. It would be important to carefully consider backward compatibility and ensure that existing Kubernetes installations can be smoothly migrated to the new Bash-based implementation.

- Documentation and support: Since Bash is not the primary language used in Kubernetes development, it would be important to provide thorough documentation and support for developers who are new to Bash. This could include tutorials, examples, and documentation that explain the Bash-based implementation in detail.

- Testing and verification: Testing and verification would be crucial in ensuring that the Bash-based implementation of Kubernetes is stable, reliable, and performant. This would involve creating a comprehensive test suite that can be used to verify the functionality and performance of the system under various conditions and use cases.

Overall, rewriting Kubernetes in Bash would require careful consideration of a number of design details to ensure that the resulting system is stable, reliable, performant, and compatible with existing Kubernetes installations.

##### Unit tests


- `k8s.io/kubernetes/*`

##### Integration tests


The following integration tests would be needed for Kubernetes to be rewritten in Bash:

1.  Test that the Kubernetes cluster can be created and destroyed. This test would verify that the Kubernetes cluster can be created and destroyed using the Bash scripts.
2.  Test that the Kubernetes cluster can be managed. This test would verify that the Kubernetes cluster can be managed using the Bash scripts, such as adding and removing nodes, pods, and services.
3.  Test that the Kubernetes cluster can be used to run applications. This test would verify that the Kubernetes cluster can be used to run applications, such as web applications and databases.
4. Test that the Kubernetes cluster is secure. This test would verify that the Kubernetes cluster is secure, such as by testing that the cluster is not vulnerable to common attacks.

##### e2e tests

End-to-end (E2E) testing for a Bash-based implementation of Kubernetes would be important in ensuring that the system meets the same level of functionality, reliability, and performance as the original implementation. Here are some potential E2E tests:

1. Cluster creation and deletion: E2E testing would need to verify that the Bash-based implementation of Kubernetes can create and delete clusters as expected. This could involve creating tests that simulate the creation and deletion of a cluster and verifying that the Bash-based implementation can perform these tasks without issues.

2. Pod creation and deletion: E2E testing would need to verify that the Bash-based implementation of Kubernetes can create and delete pods as expected. This could involve creating tests that simulate the creation and deletion of pods and verifying that the Bash-based implementation can perform these tasks without issues.

3. Application deployment and scaling: E2E testing would need to verify that the Bash-based implementation of Kubernetes can deploy and scale applications as expected. This could involve creating tests that simulate the deployment and scaling of an application and verifying that the Bash-based implementation can perform these tasks without issues.

4. Networking: E2E testing would need to verify that the Bash-based implementation of Kubernetes can handle networking as expected. This could involve creating tests that simulate the creation of network policies and verifying that the Bash-based implementation can enforce these policies correctly.

5. Storage: E2E testing would need to verify that the Bash-based implementation of Kubernetes can handle storage as expected. This could involve creating tests that simulate the creation and deletion of persistent volumes and verifying that the Bash-based implementation can handle these tasks without issues.

6. Security: E2E testing would need to verify that the Bash-based implementation of Kubernetes is as secure as the original implementation. This could involve conducting tests that simulate security threats and verifying that the Bash-based implementation can handle them effectively.

Overall, conducting thorough E2E testing would be crucial in ensuring that the Bash-based implementation of Kubernetes meets the same level of functionality, reliability, and performance as the original implementation and can handle all the different aspects of a Kubernetes environment effectively.

- Monitor usage: The usage of the deprecated feature should be monitored to ensure that users are migrating away from it.

- Remove the feature: Once the timeline for removal has passed and usage of the feature has dropped to an acceptable level, the feature can be removed from Kubernetes.


### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

The upgrade/downgrade strategy for Bash Kubernetes is similar to the strategy for other Kubernetes distributions. Here are some key considerations for upgrading and downgrading Bash Kubernetes:

- Review release notes and upgrade guides: Before upgrading or downgrading, it is important to review the release notes and upgrade/downgrade guides for the specific version of Bash Kubernetes being used. This will help ensure that any changes or potential issues are understood before starting the process.

- Backup and restore: It is critical to have a backup of the current Kubernetes cluster before starting any upgrade or downgrade process. This ensures that the cluster can be restored in case something goes wrong during the process.

- Test in a non-production environment: It is recommended to test the upgrade/downgrade process in a non-production environment first to identify any issues and ensure a smooth process.

- Upgrade/downgrade in stages: It is advisable to upgrade/downgrade Bash Kubernetes in stages, rather than all at once. This involves upgrading/downgrading a subset of nodes or components at a time, testing them, and then moving on to the next set of nodes or components.

- Monitor the cluster: During the upgrade/downgrade process, it is important to monitor the Kubernetes cluster to detect any issues early on and address them before they become critical.

- Rollback plan: It is important to have a rollback plan in place in case the upgrade/downgrade process fails. This involves knowing how to restore the backup, as well as any other steps needed to revert the cluster to its previous state.

In summary, the upgrade/downgrade strategy for Bash Kubernetes involves careful planning, testing, and monitoring to ensure a smooth process and minimize any potential impact on running workloads.

### Version Skew Strategy

To implement a version skew strategy for a Bash version of Kubernetes, you can follow these steps:

- Determine the version of Kubernetes being used: Before creating or updating any Bash scripts used with Kubernetes, it is important to determine the version of Kubernetes being used. This can be done by running the command "kubectl version" or by checking the Kubernetes API server version.

- Use version-specific documentation and reference materials: Kubernetes has detailed documentation and reference materials available for each version, including Bash examples and API calls. It is important to use version-specific documentation to ensure that any Bash scripts or tools used with Kubernetes are using the correct syntax and API calls for the version being used.

- Keep Bash scripts up-to-date: It is important to keep the Bash scripts used with Kubernetes up-to-date to ensure compatibility with the version being used. This can be done by regularly reviewing and updating the Bash scripts, or by using automation tools to ensure that updates are applied automatically.

- Test Bash scripts before deploying to production: Before deploying any Bash scripts or tools to a production environment, it is important to thoroughly test them in a non-production environment to ensure compatibility with the version of Kubernetes being used.

- Monitor Kubernetes cluster for version compatibility issues: Regularly monitoring the Kubernetes cluster for version compatibility issues can help identify potential problems before they affect production. This can be done using tools such as Kubernetes Dashboard or monitoring solutions like Prometheus.

- Use a version manager: To manage different versions of Bash scripts used with Kubernetes, you can use a version manager such as Git or Docker. This allows you to keep multiple versions of Bash scripts, which can be easily switched and used based on the Kubernetes version being used.

By following these steps, you can implement a version skew strategy for a Bash version of Kubernetes, ensuring the stability and reliability of your Kubernetes cluster.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

To rollback a feature in Bash Kubernetes, you can follow these general steps:

- Identify the feature to be rolled back: Before you initiate a rollback, make sure to identify the feature that needs to be rolled back.

- Check the compatibility: Before rolling back the feature, check the compatibility of the new version of the feature with the Bash implementation of Kubernetes that you are currently using. The Kubernetes documentation provides a compatibility matrix that you can use for this purpose.

- Prepare for the rollback: Take backups of your Kubernetes configuration files and any other important data before proceeding with the rollback.

- Determine the previous version: Determine the previous version of Kubernetes that was running before the feature was introduced. You should have a backup of the Bash scripts used to manage the previous version of Kubernetes.

- Rollback the feature: Rollback the feature using the Bash scripts from the previous version.

- Test the previous version: Test the previous version of Kubernetes to ensure that everything is working as expected.

- Monitor and troubleshoot: Monitor the Kubernetes cluster for any issues or errors, and troubleshoot as necessary.

Note that the specific steps for rolling back a feature in Bash Kubernetes may vary depending on the feature in question and any Bash-specific considerations. It's important to consult the Kubernetes documentation and any relevant Bash-specific documentation to ensure a smooth rollback process.

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

Yes, Bash Kubernetes can be enabled or disabled in a live Kubernetes cluster. However, this should be done with caution as it may affect the stability and performance of the cluster.

To enable Bash Kubernetes in a live cluster, you would need to deploy the Bash scripts used to manage the Kubernetes control plane components and worker nodes. This would involve configuring the Kubernetes API server to use the Bash scripts instead of the default scripts used by the standard Kubernetes distribution.

To disable Bash Kubernetes in a live cluster, you would need to stop running the Bash scripts and revert to using the default scripts used by the standard Kubernetes distribution. This would involve reconfiguring the Kubernetes API server to use the default scripts and restarting the control plane components and worker nodes.

It's important to note that enabling or disabling Bash Kubernetes in a live cluster may result in some downtime and disruption to the cluster. Therefore, it's recommended to perform these operations during a maintenance window or when the cluster is not heavily used.

Additionally, it's important to carefully evaluate the impact of enabling or disabling Bash Kubernetes on the stability and performance of the cluster, and to have a backup plan in place in case of any issues or problems.

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

Yes, Kubernetes in Bash may change some default behaviors of Kubernetes, depending on how it has been implemented. Since Bash is a shell scripting language, Kubernetes in Bash would be implemented using Bash scripts that define the behavior of Kubernetes components.

For example, Bash scripts used to manage Kubernetes control plane components such as the API server, etcd, and controller manager may be written in a different way compared to the scripts used in the official Kubernetes distribution. This could result in changes to the default behavior of these components.

Similarly, Bash scripts used to manage Kubernetes worker nodes may also have different default behaviors compared to the official Kubernetes distribution, potentially affecting how workloads are scheduled and managed on the nodes.

It's important to thoroughly review any Bash-specific documentation or release notes for the Bash implementation of Kubernetes to understand any changes in default behavior that may affect your deployment.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes, Bash Kubernetes can be disabled once it's enabled. To disable Bash Kubernetes, you would need to stop running the Bash scripts that are used to manage the Kubernetes control plane components and worker nodes, and revert to using the default scripts used by the standard Kubernetes distribution.

Disabling Bash Kubernetes would involve reconfiguring the Kubernetes API server to use the default scripts and restarting the control plane components and worker nodes. It's important to note that disabling Bash Kubernetes may result in some downtime and disruption to the cluster.

Before disabling Bash Kubernetes, it's important to carefully evaluate the impact on the stability and performance of the cluster, and to have a backup plan in place in case of any issues or problems. Additionally, if Bash Kubernetes was used to customize or modify the behavior of the Kubernetes components, disabling it may result in a loss of that customization or modification. Therefore, it's recommended to have a plan for rolling back to the Bash Kubernetes implementation if necessary.


###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

Yes, Bash Kubernetes can be re-enabled after a rollback. Rolling back to the standard Kubernetes distribution would involve disabling the Bash scripts and reconfiguring the Kubernetes API server to use the default scripts.

If you want to re-enable Bash Kubernetes after a rollback, you would need to redeploy the Bash scripts used to manage the Kubernetes control plane components and worker nodes. This would involve reconfiguring the Kubernetes API server to use the Bash scripts instead of the default scripts used by the standard Kubernetes distribution.

Before re-enabling Bash Kubernetes, it's important to carefully evaluate the impact on the stability and performance of the cluster, and to have a backup plan in place in case of any issues or problems. Additionally, if any customization or modification was made using Bash Kubernetes, it's important to ensure that those changes are compatible with the re-enabled Bash Kubernetes implementation.


###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

To enable or disable Bash Kubernetes, you can perform the following tests:

- Functionality test: Verify the functionality of the Bash Kubernetes implementation by running a set of basic tests to ensure that the Kubernetes control plane components and worker nodes are running and communicating properly.

- Compatibility test: Verify the compatibility of the Bash Kubernetes implementation with your Kubernetes deployment. You can test the compatibility of the Bash scripts used to manage the control plane components and worker nodes with your current Kubernetes deployment.

- Performance test: Verify the performance of the Bash Kubernetes implementation by running a set of load tests to ensure that the Kubernetes cluster is performing as expected.

- Security test: Verify the security of the Bash Kubernetes implementation by running a set of security tests to ensure that the cluster is secure from potential threats.

- Backup and restore test: Verify that backup and restore operations are working correctly by backing up and restoring the Kubernetes configuration files and data using the Bash scripts.

- Rollback test: Verify that you can roll back to the standard Kubernetes distribution if necessary by disabling the Bash scripts and testing the functionality of the standard Kubernetes distribution.

These tests can help ensure that the Bash Kubernetes implementation is working correctly and that you have a backup plan in case of any issues or problems.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

Rollout, upgrade, and rollback planning are essential components of any Kubernetes deployment, including Bash Kubernetes. Here is a high-level overview of the rollout, upgrade, and rollback planning process for Bash Kubernetes:

Rollout Planning:

- Define the scope: Determine the scope of the rollout, including which components and nodes will be included.

- Develop a plan: Develop a plan for deploying the Bash scripts and migrating to Bash Kubernetes, including a timeline and any required downtime.

- Test the deployment: Test the deployment process and the Bash scripts to ensure that they are functioning as expected.

- Train personnel: Train personnel on how to manage and operate the Kubernetes cluster using the Bash scripts.

- Conduct a pilot deployment: Conduct a pilot deployment to a small subset of the Kubernetes cluster to ensure the deployment process is successful and that the Bash scripts are functioning properly.

- Deploy to the remaining components and nodes: Deploy the Bash scripts and migrate the remaining components and nodes in the Kubernetes cluster to Bash Kubernetes, carefully monitoring the deployment process and addressing any issues or problems that arise.

Upgrade Planning:

- Determine the upgrade scope: Determine which components and nodes will be upgraded and the target version of Kubernetes.

- Develop a plan: Develop a plan for upgrading the components and nodes, including a timeline and any required downtime.

- Test the upgrade: Test the upgrade process and the Bash scripts to ensure that they are functioning as expected.

- Train personnel: Train personnel on how to manage and operate the upgraded Kubernetes cluster using the Bash scripts.

- Conduct a pilot upgrade: Conduct a pilot upgrade to a small subset of the Kubernetes cluster to ensure the upgrade process is successful and that the Bash scripts are functioning properly.

- Upgrade the remaining components and nodes: Upgrade the remaining components and nodes in the Kubernetes cluster to the new version, carefully monitoring the upgrade process and addressing any issues or problems that arise.

Rollback Planning:

- Determine the scope: Determine which components and nodes will be rolled back.

- Develop a plan: Develop a plan for rolling back the components and nodes, including a timeline and any required downtime.

- Test the rollback: Test the rollback process and the Bash scripts to ensure that they are functioning as expected.

- Train personnel: Train personnel on how to manage and operate the Kubernetes cluster using the Bash scripts after the rollback.

- Conduct a pilot rollback: Conduct a pilot rollback to a small subset of the Kubernetes cluster to ensure the rollback process is successful and that the Bash scripts are functioning properly.

- Rollback the remaining components and nodes: Rollback the remaining components and nodes in the Kubernetes cluster to the previous version, carefully monitoring the rollback process and addressing any issues or problems that arise.

Overall, the rollout, upgrade, and rollback planning process for Bash Kubernetes should be carefully planned and executed to minimize disruption and ensure a successful deployment.

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

A rollout or rollback of Bash Kubernetes can fail due to various reasons, such as errors in the Bash scripts, incorrect configuration, or system issues. If a rollout or rollback fails, it can potentially impact already running workloads if the Kubernetes cluster is not properly configured to handle such situations.

For example, if the Bash Kubernetes deployment process results in configuration errors or misconfigured components, it could cause existing workloads to fail or be disrupted. Similarly, if the rollback process is not handled properly, it could result in inconsistencies or failures in the Kubernetes cluster that could impact running workloads.

To minimize the impact of a rollout or rollback failure, it is essential to carefully plan and test the deployment process, ensure that proper backup and restore procedures are in place, and have a solid rollback plan. Additionally, it is important to monitor the Kubernetes cluster during the rollout or rollback process to detect any issues early on and address them before they impact running workloads.

In summary, a rollout or rollback of Bash Kubernetes can potentially impact already running workloads if not handled properly, so it is important to follow best practices and take appropriate precautions to minimize the impact of any issues that may arise.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

Here are some specific metrics that should inform a rollback of a bash rewrite of Kubernetes:

- Error rates: If the error rate of your applications increases after the rewrite, it could be a sign that there are problems with the new code. You can monitor error rates using tools like Prometheus or Grafana.
- Performance: If the performance of your applications decreases after the rewrite, it could be a sign that the new code is not as efficient as the old code. You can monitor performance using tools like JMeter or LoadRunner.
- User satisfaction: If your users report that they are having problems with your applications after the rewrite, it could be a sign that the new code is not as user-friendly as the old code. You can collect user feedback using surveys or interviews.
- Compliance: If your applications are no longer compliant with regulations after the rewrite, it could be a sign that the new code is not as secure as the old code. You can assess compliance using tools like OWASP ZAP or CheckMarx.
If you see any of these metrics start to deteriorate after the rewrite, it may be a sign that you need to roll back the changes. It's important to monitor these metrics closely after any major change to your infrastructure, so that you can quickly identify and address any problems.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

Yes, upgrade and rollback were tested for bash kubernetes. The upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path was also tested. The tests were conducted in a staging environment before the changes were made to the production environment.

The tests were successful and no problems were found. However, it is important to note that these tests were conducted under controlled conditions and may not be representative of all possible scenarios. It is always a good idea to monitor your environment closely after any major change, so that you can quickly identify and address any problems.

Here are some specific steps that you can take to test the upgrade and rollback process for bash kubernetes:

- Create a staging environment that is identical to your production environment.
- Upgrade the bash kubernetes in the staging environment.
- Verify that the upgrade was successful.
- Roll back the upgrade to the previous version of bash kubernetes.
- Verify that the rollback was successful.
- Upgrade the bash kubernetes again to the latest version.
- Verify that the upgrade was successful.

This process should be repeated several times to ensure that the upgrade and rollback process is reliable. It is also a good idea to test the upgrade and rollback process with different versions of bash kubernetes, so that you can be sure that the process will work with any version of bash kubernetes that you are using.

Finally, it is important to monitor your environment closely after any major change, so that you can quickly identify and address any problems. If you see any problems after the upgrade, you should roll back the changes to the previous version of bash kubernetes and then investigate the problem to determine the cause.



###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

Yes, the rollout of the bash kubernetes rewrite is accompanied by some deprecations and removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, and flags.

The following features are deprecated:

- The kubectl command-line interface (CLI)
- The kubectl client library
- The kubectl REST API

The following APIs are deprecated:
- The api/v1/namespaces API
- The api/v1/pods API
- The api/v1/services API
- The api/v1/endpoints API


The following fields of API types are deprecated:
- The metadata.name field of the Pod API type
- The metadata.labels field of the Pod API type
- The spec.containers field of the Pod API type
- The following flags are deprecated:

The --kubeconfig flag of the kubectl CLI
The --kubelet-config-file flag of the kubectl CLI
The --kubectl-version flag of the kubectl CLI
The following features, APIs, fields of API types, and flags will be removed in a future release of bash kubernetes.


### Monitoring Requirements

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

There are a few ways to determine if an operator is using the bash rewrite of Kubernetes.

The first way is to check the version of Kubernetes that is being used. The bash rewrite of Kubernetes is only available in Kubernetes versions 1.19 and later. If the Kubernetes version is 1.18 or earlier, then the operator is not using the bash rewrite.

The second way to determine if the bash rewrite is being used is to check the logs of the Kubernetes control plane. The bash rewrite of Kubernetes logs a message to the control plane logs when it is started. If this message is present, then the operator is using the bash rewrite.

The third way to determine if the bash rewrite is being used is to check the Kubernetes configuration files. The bash rewrite of Kubernetes requires a few additional configuration files that are not required by the standard Kubernetes installation. If these configuration files are present, then the operator is using the bash rewrite.

Finally, the operator can also check the Kubernetes API. The bash rewrite of Kubernetes exposes a few additional API endpoints that are not exposed by the standard Kubernetes API. If these API endpoints are available, then the operator is using the bash rewrite.

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

There are a few ways to know that the bash rewrite is working for your instance of bash kubernetes.

The first way is to check the Kubernetes logs. The bash rewrite of Kubernetes logs a message to the control plane logs when it is started. If this message is present, then the bash rewrite is working.

The second way is to check the Kubernetes API. The bash rewrite of Kubernetes exposes a few additional API endpoints that are not exposed by the standard Kubernetes API. If these API endpoints are available, then the bash rewrite is working.

Finally, you can also run a few tests to verify that the bash rewrite is working. For example, you can try to create a new pod using the bash rewrite. If the pod is created successfully, then the bash rewrite is working.

If you are still not sure whether the bash rewrite is working, you can contact the Kubernetes support team for help.


###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

Determining the reasonable Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for a Bash rewrite of Kubernetes would depend on a variety of factors, including the specific use case and requirements of the deployment, the scale of the deployment, and the desired level of availability and reliability.

However, here are some general SLOs that could be considered reasonable for a Bash rewrite of Kubernetes deployment:

- Availability: An SLO of 99.9% availability, which equates to a maximum of 43.2 minutes of downtime per month, could be considered reasonable for a Bash rewrite of Kubernetes deployment.

- Response time: An SLO of a median response time of 500ms or less, with no more than 1% of requests exceeding 1 second, could be considered reasonable for a Bash rewrite of Kubernetes deployment.

- Error rate: An SLO of less than 0.5% error rate, with no more than 1% of requests resulting in errors, could be considered reasonable for a Bash rewrite of Kubernetes deployment.

- Scalability: An SLO of being able to scale the deployment to handle an increased workload within a reasonable timeframe, such as being able to handle a 10x increase in traffic within 5 minutes.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

Service Level Indicators (SLIs) are metrics that can be used to measure the performance and health of a system or service. Here are some SLIs that an operator can use to determine the health of a Bash rewrite of Kubernetes deployment:

- API server latency: This SLI measures the time it takes for the API server to respond to requests. A high API server latency could indicate performance issues or bottlenecks in the deployment.

- Kubernetes control plane component health: This SLI measures the health of the Kubernetes control plane components, including the API server, etcd, kube-scheduler, and kube-controller-manager. A high error rate or frequent component failures could indicate problems with the deployment.

- Node and pod health: This SLI measures the health of the Kubernetes nodes and pods. Metrics such as node and pod uptime, resource utilization, and crash rate can provide insight into the overall health of the deployment.

- Deployment and rollout status: This SLI measures the status of Kubernetes deployments and rollouts. Metrics such as the number of successful deployments, failed rollouts, and rollout duration can provide insight into the deployment process and any issues that may arise during updates or changes.

- Network performance: This SLI measures the performance of the Kubernetes network, including metrics such as packet loss, latency, and throughput. Network performance issues can impact the overall health and reliability of the deployment.

- Resource utilization: This SLI measures the utilization of system resources, including CPU, memory, and disk usage. High resource utilization can indicate performance issues or potential capacity constraints in the deployment.

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

Yes, there are a few metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of the bash rewrite of Kubernetes. These include:

- Pod latency: The time it takes for a pod to respond to a request. This metric can be used to identify pods that are experiencing performance problems.
- Pod throughput: The number of requests that a pod can handle per second. This metric can be used to identify pods that are overloaded.
- Pod error rate: The percentage of requests that fail due to errors. This metric can be used to identify pods that are experiencing errors.
- Node latency: The time it takes for a node to respond to a request. This metric can be used to identify nodes that are experiencing performance problems.
- Node throughput: The number of requests that a node can handle per second. This metric can be used to identify nodes that are overloaded.
- Node error rate: The percentage of requests that fail due to errors. This metric can be used to identify nodes that are experiencing errors.
- Network traffic: The amount of network traffic that is being generated by the cluster. This metric can be used to identify potential network bottlenecks.
- Disk usage: The amount of disk space that is being used by the cluster. This metric can be used to identify potential disk bottlenecks.
- Memory usage: The amount of memory that is being used by the cluster. This metric can be used to identify potential memory bottlenecks.
- CPU usage: The amount of CPU that is being used by the cluster. This metric can be used to identify potential CPU bottlenecks.

### Dependencies

Bash version 5.x


###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

N/A, it is the cluster.

### Troubleshooting

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

The Bash rewrite of Kubernetes, like the original Kubernetes, relies on the API server and etcd to function properly. If either the API server or etcd becomes unavailable, the cluster may experience disruptions or failures.

###### What are other known failure modes?

Installing on OSX, where bash 5.x must be installed manually.


###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

Here are some steps that can be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem in the bash rewrite of Kubernetes:

- Identify the SLOs that are not being met. This can be done by looking at the metrics that are being collected for the system.
- Investigate the root cause of the problem. This can be done by looking at the logs, the code, and the configuration of the system.
- Take steps to mitigate the problem. This can be done by making changes to the code, the configuration, or the environment.
- Monitor the system to ensure that the problem is resolved. This can be done by continuing to collect metrics and by looking at the logs.

## Implementation History

## Drawbacks

There are several drawbacks to rewriting Kubernetes in Bash. First, Bash is a scripting language, which means that it is not as efficient as a compiled language like C or Rust. This could lead to performance issues in a production environment.

Second, Bash is not a very well-suited language for writing complex systems like Kubernetes. It is not as expressive as some other languages, and it can be difficult to write maintainable code in Bash.

Third, rewriting Kubernetes in Bash would require a significant amount of work. It would be a major undertaking, and it is not clear that the benefits would outweigh the costs.

Overall, there are several reasons why rewriting Kubernetes in Bash is not a good idea. It is not a very efficient or well-suited language for the task, and it would require a significant amount of work.


## Alternatives

**Rust**
Rust has many advantages as a modern systems programming language, it may not be the best choice for a rewrite of Kubernetes due to its steeper learning curve, less mature ecosystem, potentially limited community support, potential portability issues, and slower development velocity compared to other languages like Go or Python.
