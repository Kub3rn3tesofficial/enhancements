## Summary

The primary goal of this enhancement is to define the OperatingSystem scheduling requirements for a Pod in a manner which is common in the Kubelet as well as the KubernetesControlPlane.
on which a pod would like to run.


## Motivation

Identifying the OS of the pods during the API Server admission time is crucial to apply
appropriate security constraints to the pod. In the absence of having information about a target OS for a pod, some admission
plugins may apply unnecessary security constraints to the pods(which may prevent them from running properly) or in the
worst case, don't apply security constraints at all.


### Goals

Admission plugins and/or Admission Webhooks identifying the Operating System on which
pod intends to run.

### Non-Goals

- Interaction with container runtimes.
- Interaction with scheduler (this may change in future).

## Proposal


Identifying the pods targeting Windows nodes during the scheduling phase can be done
in the following ways:
- Based on [nodeSelector and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/windows/user-guide-windows-containers/#ensuring-os-specific-workloads-land-on-the-appropriate-container-host) in the pod spec with 
  Windows node specific labels.
- Based on [runtimeclasses](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/windows/user-guide-windows-containers/#ensuring-os-specific-workloads-land-on-the-appropriate-container-host) in the pod spec

The runtimeclass is a higher level abstraction which gets translated again to nodeSelectors+tolerations. While the 
nodeSelector with reserved OS label is good enough, it has following shortcomings:

- It can be viewed as an side-effect of scheduling constraints 
and need not necessarily express the user intention fully.
- The pod may target Windows node but pod OS may be linux or windows
as Linux Containers on Windows(LCOW) can be supported in future.

So, we propose to add a new field to the pod spec called 
os to identify the OS on which pod intends to run.

```go
type PodSpec struct {
  // If specified, indicates the type of OS on which pod intends
  // to run.  This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that 
  // enable the IdentifyOS feature. This is used to help identifying the
  // OS authoritatively during the API server admission.
  // +optional
  OS *OS
}

// OS has information on the type of OS. 
// We're making this a struct for possible future expansion.
type OS struct {
  // Name of the OS. The values supported are available at:
  // https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/config.md#platform-specific-configuration
  Name string
}

```

With the above change, all the admission plugins which validate or mutate the pod can 
identify the pod's OS authoritatively and can act accordingly. As of now, PodSecurityAdmission
plugin is the only admission plugin can leverage this field on the pod spec. In addition, API validators like ValidatePod and ValidaPodUpdate should be modified. In future, we can
have a validating admission plugin for Windows pods as Linux and Windows host capabilities are
different and not all Kubernetes features are supported on Windows host.


### User Stories (Optional)


#### Story 1

As a Kubernetes cluster administrator, I want appropriate security contexts to be 
applied to my Windows Pods along with Linux pods

#### Story 2

As a Kubernetes cluster administrator, I want to use my own admission webhook for pods
based on the OS it intends to run on.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

Since the OS field is optional in the pod spec, we can expect the users to omit this field
when submitting pod to API server. In this scenario, we expect admission plugins to treat the pod
the way it is being treated now.

### Risks and Mitigations

The primary risk is a bug in the implementation of the admission plugins that validate or mutate
based on the OS field in the pod spec. The best mitigation for that scenario is unit testing 
when this featuregate is enabled and disabled.


## Design Details

### Implications to Kubelet

Apart from the above API change, we intend to make the following changes to Kubelet:
- Kubelet should reject admitting pod if the kubelet cannot honor the pod.Spec.OS.Name. For instance, if the OS.Name does not match the host os.
- Kubelet should reject admitting pods if the pod contains a nodeSelector with label `kubenetes.io/os` with a value 
not matching `runtime.GOOS`. We can use this check as `kubernetes.io/os` value is supposed to be filled from `runtime.GOOS`. 

Having the above checks in kubelet helps in the following conditions:
- If scheduler has been by passed by setting the nodeName directly on the pod spec.
- A malicious user or a user unknowingly with RBAC to just bind pod to node, can associate pod to node there by bypassing the scheduler.

As of now, Kubelet doesn't reconcile the value of `kubernetes.io/os`. So, it'd be nice to have the reconciliation as part of this change.


### Implications to Scheduler

We let the users to explicitly specify nodeSelectors+tolerations or runtimeclasses to express their intention
to run an particular OS. However, in future, once the OS struct expands, we can see if we can leverage those fields to
express scheduling constraints. During the alpha, we assume there are no scheduling implications.


### Test Plan

- Unit tests covering API server defaulting to various fields within pod with and without this feature
- Unit tests covering admission plugins which validate/mutate pod spec based on this feature
- Unit and E2E tests for Kubelet changes.

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Basic units and e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Alpha -> Beta Graduation
- Expand the e2e tests with more scenarios
- Gather feedback from end users
- Tests are in Testgrid and linked in the KEP

#### Alpha -> Beta Graduation
- 2 examples of end users using this field

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

- Upgrades:
  When upgrading from a release without this feature, to a release with `IdentifyOS` feature enabled, there is no change to existing behavior unless user specifies
  OS field in the pod spec.
- Downgrades:
  When downgrading from a release with this feature to a release without `IdentifyOS`, the current behavior will continue.
### Version Skew Strategy

If the feature gate is enabled there are some kubelet implications as the code to strip security constraints based on OS can be removed and we need to add
admission/denying in the kubelet logic which was mentioned above. Older Kubelets without this change will continue stripping the unnecessary fields in the pod spec which is the current behavior.


## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire


### Feature Enablement and Rollback



###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?


- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: IdentifyOS
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
    - kubelet
    - kube-apiserver

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?
A Kubelet with a misscheduled pod (i.e. trying to run a windows pod on a linux node) will fail *before* trying to run a container (i.e. it will never actually invoke the underlying CRI), as opposed to after.

<!--
Any change of default behavior may be surprising to users or break existing
automations, so be extremely careful here.
-->

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes. Using the featuregate is the only way to enable/disable this feature. We'd have unit tests which exercise the update validation code which changes as a result of this feature. The change to update validation comes from the fact that we will allow certain fields to be empty or invalidated when this OS field in the pod spec is set.

<!--
Describe the consequences on existing workloads (e.g., if this is a runtime
feature, can it break the existing applications?).

NOTE: Also set `disable-supported` to `true` or `false` in `kep.yaml`.
-->

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

The admission plugins/Kubelet can act based on the OS field in pod spec if set by the end-user

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?
Yes, unit and e2es tests for feature enabled, disabled


### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning


###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?
It shouldn't impact already running workloads. This is an opt-in feature since users need to explicitly set the OS parameter in the Pod spec i.e .spec.os field. 
If the feature is disabled the field is preserved if it was already set in the presisted pod object, otherwise it is silently dropped.


###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?
N/A

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?
Not yet tested.


###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?
None. This feature will be additive


### Monitoring Requirements


###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

By looking at the pod's spec. Some fields like Security Constraint Contexts may not
be applied to the pod spec if the proper OS has been set.

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

Windows Pods and Linux Pods with proper OS field set in the pod spec would cause pods
to run properly on desired OS


- [x] Events
  - Event Reason: Kubelet will send pod admitted/denied event.
- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name: 
  - Other field: 
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?
All the pods which have OS field set in the pod spec should have OS specific constraints/defaults applied.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?


- [ ] Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [x] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details: Linux Specific SCCs not available on Windows pod specs and vice-versa

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?


### Dependencies


###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?
None


### Scalability



###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?
No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?
Yes


###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?
No


###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?
It increases the size of Pod object since a new string field is added.


###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?
No


###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?
No

### Troubleshooting


###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?


###### What are other known failure modes?



###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

## Implementation History



## Drawbacks

## Alternatives

Relying on nodeSelectors to identify the Pod OS.
Following are the reasons to not choose this approach:
- Piggybacking on nodeSelectors+tolerations to definitively identify Pod OS may not be ideal experience for end-users as they can convey scheduling constraints using the same
abstractions
- We can use this field when the hostOS is not not always equal to Container OS. For example, Linux Containers on Windows(using WSL) is an example.

not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
