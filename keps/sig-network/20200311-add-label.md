## Summary

This KEP is to add property field in PodIP structure, to add additional information for Pod IP
and to provide mechanism to flexible endpoint/endpointslice manages among multiple controllers.

## Motivation

Currently Kubernetes Pod has multiple IP addresses, based on [sig-network/20180612-ipv4-ipv6-dual-stack.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/20180612-ipv4-ipv6-dual-stack.md). In the kep, `property` field is also discussed to add additional information, such as interface name, gateway etc, even though it is not implemented yet. 

### Goals

   * Provide flexible way for custom endpoint/endpointslice controller to pick up IPs from Pod, based on properties
   * Provide the properties, `service.kubernetes.io/service-controller-name` to specify which the endpoint/endpointslice controller use the IP for endpoint/endpointslice

### Non-Goals

   * This KEP does not change any semantics in the Endpoint/EndpointSlice 

## Proposal

This KEP is to add property field in PodIP of PodStatus to add information for Pod IP
and to provide mechanism to flexible endpoint/endpointslice manages among multiple controllers.

### User Stories [optional]

#### Endpoint Selection for the certain service (IPv4/IPv6)

In IPv4/v6 dual-stack case, even though pod has multiple IP, user may want to provide service IPv6 only
(or v4 only). In this case, endpoint controller could generate endpoints with filtering based on properties,
as well as endpointslice.

#### Multiple Service/Endpoint Controller in the cluster

In this scenario, user is going to use several controller for service: kubernetes service/endpoint
controller and 3rd party service/endpoint controller and user want to specify which IP address is for
which service/endpoint controller (i.e. kubernetes or 3rd party).

## Design Details

### PodStatus API Change

This proposal adds `Property` in PodIP structure (of PodStatus)

```
type PodIP struct {
    // ip is an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) assigned to the pod
    IP string `json:"ip,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=ip"`
+    // properties is  Arbitrary metadata associated with the allocated IP
+    Properties map[string]string `json:"ip,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,2,rep,opt,name=properties"`
}
```

### Provide well-known property 

This proposal introduces `service.kubernetes.io/service-controller-name`, that specifies
which endpoint/endpointslice controller uses the service. If there is no property,
`service.kubernetes.io/managed-by`, then kubernetes endpoint/endpointslice controller uses this IP
for that, as `service.kubernetes.io/service-proxy-name` of kube-proxy. If there is a property,
`service.kubernetes.io/service-controller-name`, then kubernetes endpoint controller does not use
this IP because 3rd party controller is going to use it.

### Test Plan

The following end-to-end test is implemented in addition to unit tests:

- Create service for the pod with property 'service.kubernetes.io/service-controller-name' in PodIP


### Graduation Criteria

* Enable by default and soak for 1+ releases
* Compatible with major systems (e.g. linux, windows)


## Implementation History

* 2020- Design proposal first draft
