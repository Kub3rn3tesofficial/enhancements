# EndpointSlice API 

## Summary 

This KEP was converted from the [original proposal doc][original-doc]. The current  [Core/V1 Endpoints API][v1-endpoints-api] comes with severe performance/scalability drawbacks affecting multiple components in the control-plane (apiserver, etcd, endpoints-controller, kube-proxy). 
This doc proposes a new EndpointSlice API aiming to replace Core/V1 Endpoints API for most internal consumers, including kube-proxy.
The new EndpointSlice API aims to address existing problems as well as leaving room for future extension.


## Motivation

In the current Endpoints API, one object instance contains all the individual endpoints of a service. Whenever a single pod in a service is added/updated/deleted, the whole Endpoints object (even when the other endpoints didn't change) is re-computed, written to storage (etcd) and sent to all watchers (e.g. kube-proxy). This leads to 2 major problems:

- Storing multiple megabytes of endpoints puts strain on multiple parts of the system due to not having a paging system and a monolithic watch/storage design. [The max number of endpoints is bounded by the K8s storage layer (etcd)][max-object-size]], which has a hard limit on the size of a single object (1.5MB by default). That means attempts to write an object larger than the limit will be rejected. Additionally, there is a similar limitation in the watch path in Kubernetes apiserver. For a K8s service, if its Endpoints object is too large, endpoint updates will not be propagated to kube-proxy(s), and thus iptables/ipvs wonâ€™t be reprogrammed.
- [Performance degradation in large k8s deployments.][perf-degrade] Not being able to efficiently read/update individual endpoint changes can lead to (e.g during rolling upgrade of a service) endpoints operations that are quadratic in the number of its elements. If one consider watches in the picture (there's one from each kube-proxy), the situation becomes even worse as the quadratic traffic gets multiplied further with number of watches (usually equal to #nodes in the cluster).

The new EndpointSlice API aims to address existing problems as well as leaving room for future extension.


### Goal

- Support tens of thousands of backend endpoints in a single service on cluster with thousands of nodes.
- Move the API towards a general-purpose backend discovery API.
- Leave room for foreseeable extension:
  - Support multiple IPs per pod
  - More endpoint states than Ready/NotReady
  - Dynamic endpoint subsetting
  
### Non-Goal
- Change functionality provided by K8s V1 Service API.
- Provide better load balancing for K8s service backends.

## Proposal

### EndpointSlice API
The following new EndpointSlice API will be added to the `Discovery` API group.

```
type EndpointSlice struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
    // OwnerReferences should be set when the object is derived from a k8s
    // object.
    // The object labels may contain the following key:
    // kubernetes.io/service: the label value indicates the name of the
    // service from which the EndpointSlice is derived from.
    // +optional
    metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=metadata"`
    // Metadata of the Endpoints in the EndpointSlice.
    EndpointMeta `json:",inline"`
    // Endpoints of this EndpointSlice.
    // +optional
    // +listType=atomic
    Endpoints []Endpoint `json:"endpoints,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=endpoints"`
}

type Endpoint struct {
    // Required: Targets of the endpoint. Must contain at least one target.
    // Different consumers (e.g. kube-proxy) handle different types of
    // targets in the context of its own capabilities.
    // +listType=set
    Targets []string `json:"targets,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=targets"`
    // The Hostname of this endpoint.
    // +optional 
    Hostname *string `json:"hostname,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=hostname"`
    // Required: the conditions of the endpoint.
    Conditions EndpointConditions  `json:"conditions,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=conditions"`
    // Reference to object providing the endpoint.
    // +optional 
    TargetRef *v1.ObjectReference `json:"targetRef,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,4,opt,name=targetRef"`
    // Topology can contain arbitrary topology information associated with the
    // endpoint.
    // Key/value pairs contained in topology must conform with the label format.
    // https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels
    // Topology may contain the following well known keys:
    // kubernetes.io/hostname: the value indicates the hostname of the node
    // where the endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding
    // node label.
    // topology.kubernetes.io/zone: the value indicates the zone where the
    // endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding node label.
    // topology.kubernetes.io/region: the value indicates the region where the
    // endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding node label.
    // +optional 
    Topology map[string]string `json:"topology,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,5,opt,name=topology"`
}

type EndpointConditions struct {
    // Ready indicates if the endpoint is ready to serve traffic.
    Ready bool `json:"ready,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=ready"`
}

type EndpointMeta struct {
    // This field specifies the list of ports associated with each endpoint in the EndpointSlice
    // Each EndpointPort must have a unique port name.
    // +optional 
    // +listType=atomic
    Ports []EndpointPort `json:"ports,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=ports"`
}

type EndpointPort struct {
    // The name of this port. 
    // If the EndpointSlice is dervied from K8s service, this corresponds to ServicePort.Name.
    // Name must be a IANA_SVC_NAME or an empty string.
    // Default is empty string.
    // +optional 
    Name *string `json:"name,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=name"`
    // The IP protocol for this port.
    // Must be UDP, TCP, or SCTP.
    // Default is TCP.
    // +optional 
    Protocol *v1.Protocol `json:"protocol,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=protocol"`
    // The port number of the endpoint.
    // If this is not specified, ports are not restricted and must be
    // interpreted in the context of the specific consumer.
    // +optional 
    Port *int32 `json:"port,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=port"`
}

```

### Mapping
- 1 Service maps to N EndpointSlice objects.
- Each EndpointSlice contains at most 100 endpoints by default (MaxEndpointThreshold: configurable via controller flag). 
- If a EndpointSlice is derived from K8s:
  - The following label is added to identify corresponding service:  
    - Key: kubernetes.io/service
    - Value: ${service name}
  - For EndpointSlice instances that are not derived from kubernetes Services, the above label must not be applied.
  - The OwnerReferences of the EndpointSlice instances will be set to the corresponding service.
- For backend pods with non-uniform named ports (e.g. a service port targets a named port. Backend pods have different port number with the same port name), this would amplify the number of EndpointSlice object depending on the number of backend groups with same ports.
- EndpointSlice will be covered by resource quota. This is to limit the max number of EndpointSlice objects in one namespace. This would provide protection for k8s apiserver. For instance, a malicious user would not be able to DOS k8s API by creating services selecting all pods.

### EndpointMeta (Per EndpointSlice)
EndpointMeta contains metadata applying to all endpoints contained in the EndpointSlice.
- **Endpoint Port**: The endpoint port number becomes optional in the EndpointSlice API while the port number field in core/v1 Endpoints API is required. This allows the API to support services with no port remapping or all port services.   

### Topology (Per Endpoint)
A new topology field (string to string map) is added to each endpoint. It can contain arbitrary topology information associated with the endpoint. If the EndpointSlice instance is derived from K8s service, the topology may contain following well known key:
- **kubernetes.io/hostname**: the value indicates the hostname of the node where the endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding node label.
- **topology.kubernetes.io/zone**: the value indicates the zone where the endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding node label.
- **topology.kubernetes.io/region**: the value indicates the region where the endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding node label.

If the k8s service has topological keys specified, the corresponding node labels will be copied to endpoint topology. 

### EndpointSlice Naming
Use `generateName` with service name as prefix:
```
${service name}.${random}
```

## Estimation
This section provides comparisons between Endpoints API and EndpointSlice API under 3 scenarios:
- Service Creation/Deletion
- Single Endpoint Update
- Rolling Update

```
Number of Backend Pod: P
Number of Node: N
Number of Endpoint Per EndpointSlice:B 
```

## Sample Case 1: 20,000 endpoints, 5,000 nodes

## Implementation

### Requirements

- **Persistence (Minimal Churn of Endpoints)**

Upon service endpoint changes, the # of object writes and disruption to ongoing connections should be minimal. 

- **Handling Restarts & Failures**

The producer/consumer of EndpointSlice must be able to handle restarts and recreate state from scratch with minimal change to existing state.
 

### EndpointSlice Controller

A new EndpointSlice Controller will be added to `kube-controller-manager`. It will manage the lifecycle EndpointSlice instances derived from services.  
```
Watch: Service, Pod, Node ==> Manage: EndpointSlice
```

#### Workflows
On Service Create/Update/Delete:
- `syncService(svc)`

On Pod Create/Update/Delete: 
- Reverse lookup relevant services
- For each relevant service, 
  - `syncService(svc)`

`syncService(svc)`:
- Look up selected backend pods
- Look up existing EndpointSlices for the service `svc`.
- Calculate difference between wanted state and current state.  
- Perform reconciliation with minimized changes.

### Kube-Proxy

Kube-proxy will be modified to consume EndpointSlice instances besides Endpoints resource. A flag will be added to kube-proxy to toggle the mode. 

```
Watch: Service, EndpointSlice ==> Manage: iptables, ipvs, etc
```
- Merge multiple EndpointSlice into an aggregated list.
- Reuse the existing processing logic 

### Endpoint Controller (classic)
In order to ensure backward compatibility for external consumer of the core/v1 Endpoints API, the existing K8s endpoint controller will keep running until the API is EOL. The following limitations will apply:
- Starting from EndpointSlice beta: If # of endpoints in one Endpoints object exceed 1000, generate a normal event to the object.
- Starting from EndpointSlice beta: If # of endpoints in one Endpoints object exceed 1000, generate a warning event to the object. 
- Starting from EndpointSlice GA: Only include up to 1000 endpoints in one Endpoints Object and throw events.

## Roll Out Plan

| K8s Version | State | OSS Controllers                                                            | Internal Consumer (Kube-proxy) |
|-------------|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1.16        | Alpha | EndpointSliceController (Alpha) EndpointController (GA with normal event)  | Endpoints                      |
| 1.17        | Beta  | EndpointSliceController (Beta)  EndpointController (GA with warning event) | EndpointSlice                  |
| 1.18        | GA    | EndpointSliceController (GA)    EndpointController (GA with limitation)    | EndpointSlice                  |




## Graduation Criteria

In order to graduate to beta, we need:

- Kube-proxy switch to consume EndpointSlice API. 
- Verify performance/scalability via testing.

## Alternatives

1. increase the etcd size limits
2. endpoints controller batches / rate limits changes
3. apiserver batches / rate-limits watch notifications
4. apimachinery to support object level pagination


## FAQ

- #### Why not pursue the alternatives?

In order to fulfill the goal of this proposal, without redesigning the Core/V1 Endpoints API, all items listed in the alternatives section are required. Item #1 increase maximum endpoints limitation by increasing the object size limit. This may bring other performance/scalability implications. Item #2 and #3 can reduce transmission overhead but sacrificed endpoint update latency. Item #4 can further reduce transmission overhead, however it is a big change to the existing API machinery. 

In summary, each of the items can only achieve incremental gain to some extent. Compared to this proposal, the combined effort would be equal or more while achieving less performance improvements. 

In addition, the EndpointSlice API is capable to express endpoint subsetting, which is the natural next step for improving k8s service endpoint scalability.      

- #### Why only include up to 100 endpoints in one EndpointSlice object? Why not 1 endpoint? Why not 1000 endpoints?

Based on the data collected from user clusters, vast majority (> 99%) of the k8s services have less than 100 endpoints. For small services, EndpointSlice API will make no difference. If the MaxEndpointThreshold is too small (e.g. 1 endpoint per EndpointSlice), controller loses capability to batch updates, hence causing worse write amplification on service creation/deletion and scale up/down. Etcd write RPS is significant limiting factor.

- #### Why do we have a condition struct for each endpoint? 

The current Endpoints API only includes a boolean state (Ready vs. NotReady) on individual endpoint. However, according to pod life cycle, there are more states (e.g. Graceful Termination, ContainerReary). In order to represent additional states other than Ready/NotReady,  a status structure is included for each endpoint. More condition types can be added in the future without compatibility disruptions. As more conditions are added, different consumer (e.g. different kube-proxy implementations) will have the option to evaluate the additional conditions.
