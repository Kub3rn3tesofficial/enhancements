## Summary

Bad _admission webhooks_ could reject/fail critical cluster requests, for example, _kube-controller-manager_ (KCM) 
and _kube-scheduler_ (KSH) lease renewal, which will put the KCM or KSH in a bad state. 

This proposal covers an approach protecting cluster critical requests from bad admission webhook. 


## Motivation

When an admission webhook with `failurePolicy` set to `fail` goes down, the admission of all matching requests defined 
by the webhook will be rejected by _kube-apiserver_. Similarly, a webhook with `timeoutSeconds` set to too long could 
potentially cause the client to give up on the requests.

Components like KCM or KSH relies on updates on lease object for 
leader election, and will break if failing to renew leadership. This is especially true if certain percentage,
say 50%, of the requests against the bad admission webhook fail, which could cause all KCM replicas to spin.

There are many admission webhooks that intercept requests against resources across all namespaces, for example,  
[opa](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa), [Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper), 
and countless customer created ones, which will interfere with KCM/KSH leases.

This is especially painful if the maintainers of KCM and admission webhook are different parties. For example, 
in a managed kubernetes cluster, KCM and KSH are maintained by the cloud provider while the admission webhook is owned 
by the customer. It is undesirable that actions from customers could break components owned by the cloud provider.


### Goals

* Even with bad admission webhooks, the KCM/KSH leader election leases can still be renewed.

### Non-Goals

* Invent another leader election mechanism, for example, by talking to a database.
* Protect objects other than KCM or KSH leases from bad webhooks.


## Proposal

Ideally, a hard-coded list of KCM/KSH lease objects is maintained in kube-apiserver and can bypass webhook. However, 
since the lease object name, namespace or type are configurable in KCM/KSH, the proposal is to have kube-apiserver 
take the KCM/KSH object name, namespaces and type as flags. If nothing is set, existing behavior is preserved (mutating 
requests against KCM/KSH lease will still go through admission webhooks).


### Risks and Mitigations

## Drawbacks

It might surprise certain people that requests against certain objects could bypass admission webhooks (today the only 
exceptions are `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` and `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration`).

## Alternatives

Rather than completely bypassing admission webhooks, alternatively, a client-side `failPolicy` and 
`timeoutSeconds` policy which overrides the ones defined by webhook configurations could be created for KCM/KSH leases
as kube-apiserver config. The downside of this approach is that a healthy webhook could still intentionally or 
unintentionally (for example, a bug) reject to admit mutating requests against KCM/KSH leases.
