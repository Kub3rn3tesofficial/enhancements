# Consistent Reads from Cache

Kubernetes Get and List requests are guaranteed to be "consistent reads" if the
`resourceVersion` parameter is not provided. Consistent reads are served from
etcd using a "quorum read".

But often the watch cache contains sufficiently up-to-date data to serve the
read request, and could serve it far more efficiently.

This KEP proposes a mechanism to serve most reads from the watch cache
while still providing the same consistency guarantees as serving the
read from etcd.

## Summary

Consistent reads may be served from cache so long as:
- A consistent (quorum) read is first made to etcd to get the latest "revision"
- The data in the watch cache no older than the latest "revision" just from etcd

etcd watches support "progress events", which provide an updated revision and a
guarantee that all future watch events will be newer than the that revision. 
Etcd client can request a progress notification from server. The progress 
notification allow the etcd watcher to know how up-to-date the watch stream 
is. This is thanks to [bookmarkable] property of etcd watch that guarantees that
all events with revision below progress notification have been delivered.

This KEP summarizes how we can take advantage of progress events efficiently
determine how up-to-date kubernetes watch caches are then serve reads from the
watch cache when they are sufficiently up-to-date.

## Motivation

Serving reads from the watch cache is more performant and scalable than reading
them from etcd, deserializing them, applying selectors, converting them to the
desired version and then garbage collecting all the objects that were allocated
during the whole process.

We will need to measure the impact to performance and scalability, but we have
enough data and experience from prior work with the watch cache to be confident
there is significant scale/perf opportunity here, and we would like to introduce
an alpha implementation.

We expect the biggest gain to be from node-originating requests (e.g. kubelet
listing pods scheduled on its node). For those requests, the size of the
response is small (it fits a single page, assuming you won't make it extremely
small), whereas the number of objects to process is proportional to cluster-size
(so fairly big). For example, when kubelets requests pods schedule against it in
a 5k node cluster with 30pods/node, the kube-apiserver must list the 150k pods
from etcd and then filter that list down to the list of 30 pods that the kubelet
actually need. This must occur for each list request from each of the 5k
kubelets. If served from watch cache, this same request can be served from
built-in index filtering out the 30 pods each kubelet needs from the data in the
cache.

In addition to the improvements to scale and performance, we aim to resolve a
specific problem. The long standing "stale read" issue
(https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/59848) remains open because
reflectors default to resourceVersion=”0” for their initial list requests. If
the reflectors instead use a consistent read for their initial list request,
they could not "going back in time" when components are restarted and this issue
would be solved. "Going back in time" can currently happen if the initial list
request is served from a stale watch cache with data much older than the
reflector has previously observed or if the api-server or etcd are partitioned.

We have held off on switching reflectors to using consistent read for the
initial list, even though we know it is more correct, due to concerns with the
impact on large scale use cases. But if we serve consistent reads from cache,
there would be very little difference in scalability to how the kube-apiserver
serves the resourceVersion="0" list requests from reflectors today.

### Goals

- Resolve the "stale read" problem (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/59848)
- Improve the scalability and performance of Kubernetes for Get and List requests, when the watch cache is enabled

### Non-Goals

- Remove all true quorum reads.
- Serving pagination continuation from watch cache.

## Proposal

### Consistent reads from cache

Guard this by a `WatchCacheConsistentReads` feature gate.

This requires using `WatchProgressRequest` which is only available in etcd 3.4+, and so would
require we make the kube-apiserver aware of etcd's minor version, which is described in more detail later.


#### Use RequestProgress to enable automatic watch updates

When a consistent LIST request is received and the watch cache is enabled:

- Get the current revision from etcd for the resource type being served.
  Use the [getCurrentResourceVersionFromStorage] added as part of [Watch-List KEP].
- If the cache already has the current revision, serve the request from cache. If not,
  - Send a `WatchProgressRequest` to etcd on the watch channel that the watch cache is consuming.
- Use the existing `waitUntilFreshAndBlock` function in the watch cache to wait briefly for the watch to catch up to the current revision.
- If the block times out, the request will result in rejection. (see "What if the watch cache is stale?" section for details)

Consistent GET requests will continue to be served directly from etcd. We will
only serve consistent LIST requests from cache.

[getCurrentResourceVersionFromStorage]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/3f247e59edfd4083242ad7271d076a38291760ff/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/cacher/cacher.go#L1246-L1278
[Watch-List KEP]: /keps/sig-api-machinery/3157-watch-list

### Risks and Mitigations

### Performance

Progress notify is requested on client, so all watchers opened with this client
will get the notification. This is not a problem for Kubernetes as we maintain
one client per resource type, but could cause an issue if we attempt to reuse
the client across resource types (kubernetes/kubernetes#114458). This issue can
be mitigated by having multiple grpc watch streams within a single etcd client.

When etcd opens a watch it assigns it a stream based on its [context metadata].
So by default all watches opened on single client share single grpc stream.
To implement reusing etcd for multiple resources we should consider adding
unique metadata for each resource, forcing etcd client to create a separate
grpc stream for each of them. This way requesting progress notification on a
specific resource will result in only that single watch being notified.

[context metadata]: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/a6ab774458411a6c0ea08f5df97e4dcc9a836345/client/v3/watch.go#L1070-L1075

### Etcd compatibility

Progress notification was introduced to etcd in v3.4 (4 year release), still
only recently community discovered a bug [etcd-io/etcd#15220] that could cause a
race between sending an event and progress notification with the same revision.
The bug was only fixed in v3.4.25 and v3.5.8 (2 months old), and could cause
client missing an event.

For Alpha feature will be only available under a feature gate, and we will
depend on documenting the minimal required etcd version in feature gate
description.

[etcd-io/etcd#15220]: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/15220

<<[UNRESOLVED @serathius]>>
For Beta propose how kube-apiserver should behave if user is running 
older/affected etcd version.

Options for Beta:
* Ask user to proviede etcd version to kube-apiserver `--storage-backend=etcd3.4.25`
* Make the feature opt-in with flag `--allow-using-progress-notify`
* Have kube-apiserver check cluster version in etcd `/version` endpoint.
  Retry the check logic if `WatchProgressRequest` fails.
* Fallback to reading from etcd if no progress notification within `X` seconds.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>

### What if the watch cache is stale?

This design requires wait for a watch cache to catch up to the needed revision
for consistent reads. If the cache doesn't catch up within some time limit we
either fail the request or have a fallback.

If the fallback is to forward consistent reads to etcd, a cascading failure
is likely to occur if caches become stale and a large number of read requests
are forwarded to etcd.

Since falling back to etcd won't work, we should fail the requests and rely on
rate limiting to prevent cascading failure.  I.e. `Retry-After` HTTP header (for
well behaved clients) and [Priority and Fairness](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/20190228-priority-and-fairness.md).

## Design Details

### Pagination

Given that the watch cache does not paginate responses, how can clients requesting
pagination for resourceVersion="" reads be supported?

#### Option: Serve 1st page of paginated requests from the watch cache

Only serve the 1st page of paginated requests from the watch cache. The watch
cache would need to construct the appropriate continuation token such that the
subsequent pages can be served from etcd.

An even more conservative approach would be to only serve paginated requests
that fit within a single page from the watch cache, in which cache the watch
cache doesn't need to construct continuation tokens at all.

In practice, this options might be sufficient to get the bulk of the scalability
benefits of serving consistent reads from cache. For example, the kubelet LIST
pods use case would be handled, as would similar cases. Not all cases would
be handled.

#### Future work: Enable pagination in the watch cache

Ongoing work to support pagination in watch cache: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108003

### Test Plan

##### Prerequisite testing updates

scalability tests verifying that introducing etcd progress notify events
don't degrade performance/scalability and verifying that there are substantial
benefits to enabling consistent reads from cache.

##### Unit tests

Unit test with a mock storage backend (instead of an actual etcd) that
various orderings of progress notify events and "current revision" response
result in the watch cache serving consistent read requests correctly

- `k8s.io/kubernetes/vendor/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/cacher`: `13.06.2023` - `84`
- `k8s.io/kubernetes/vendor/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/etcd3`: `12.06.2023` - `75`

##### Integration tests

##### e2e tests

Introduce e2e test that run both with etcd progress notify events enabled
and disable to ensure both configurations work correctly (both with this
feature enabled and disabled)

Benchmark consistent reads from cache against consistent reads from etcd for:
- list result sizes of 1, 10, ..., 100000
- object sizes of 5kb, 25kb, 100kb
- measure latency and throughput
- document results in this KEP

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- Feature is implemented behind a feature gate
- Unpaginated LIST requests is served from watch cache
- First page of paginated requests is served from watch cache
- Feature performance is validated via scalability tests

#### Beta

- Implement a per-request opt-out [discussion](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1404#discussion_r381528406)
- Implement a fallback if user is running older/affected etcd version
- Feature is enabled by default

#### GA

TBD

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

N/A, kube-apiserver watch case is stateless.

### Version Skew Strategy

N/A, kube-apiserver watch case is stateless.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- Feature gate
  - Feature gate name: `WatchCacheConsistentReads`
  - Components depending on the feature gate: kube-apiserver

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No, we only change implementation details of apiserver watch cache usage.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes, by disabling the feature gate (given it's in-memory feature nothing else is needed).

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

No impact, new requests will be served from watch cache.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

No changes in API types, based on the PRR instructions those tests are not
needed.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.

## Implementation History

* 1.28 - Move to implementable.

## Alternatives

Do nothing:

- Leaves the "stale read" problem unsolved, although we have a PR fixing reflector relist which helps mitigate the larger issue.
- Does not impact scale or performance.

Allow clients to manage the initial resource version they provide to reflectors, but don’t implement this optimization:

- Many clients will most likely continue to use resourceVersion=”0” even if it violates their consistency needs
- Clients that transition to use resourceVersion=”” will pay a high scale/performance cost
- We don't expect clients to attempt to keep track of the last resourceVersion they observed. If they do attempt this, we are concerned that they might get it wrong and introduce subtle and difficult to debug issues as a result.


## Potential Future Improvements

Modify etcd to allow echo back a user provided ID in progress events.

- Client generates a UUID and provides to the ProgressNotify request
- Once client sees a progress event with the same UUID, it knows the watch is up-to-date
- This reduces the worst case number of round trips required to do a consistent read from two to one since client doesn't need to get the lastest revision from etcd first

Potential optimiation: We could delay requests, accumulate multiple in-flight
read requests over some short time period, and at the end of the period, get the
current revision from etcd, wait for the watch cache to catch up, and then serve
all the the in-flight reads from cache. This would reduce the number of "get
current revision" requests that need to be made to etcd in exchange for higher
request latency (but only for consistent reads). A simple implementation would
be to do this on a fix interval, where, obviously, if there were not reqests
during the period, we don't bother to fetch a current revision from etcd. It
is unclear if this will result in actual gain, and it would complicate the
code, so should be explored with care.
