**Note:** When your KEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [ ] **Pick a hosting SIG.**
  Make sure that the problem space is something the SIG is interested in taking
  up. KEPs should not be checked in without a sponsoring SIG.
- [ ] **Create an issue in kubernetes/enhancements**
  When filing an enhancement tracking issue, please make sure to complete all
  fields in that template. One of the fields asks for a link to the KEP. You
  can leave that blank until this KEP is filed, and then go back to the
  enhancement and add the link.
- [ ] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Copy this template into the owning SIG's directory and name it
  `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number (with no
  leading-zero padding) assigned to your enhancement above.
- [ ] **Fill out as much of the kep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Title", "Authors", "Owning-sig",
  "Status", and date-related fields.
- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections.
  These should be easy if you've preflighted the idea of the KEP with the
  appropriate SIG(s).
- [ ] **Create a PR for this KEP.**
  Assign it to people in the SIG who are sponsoring this process.
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the KEP clarified and merged quickly. The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

Just because a KEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved. Any KEP
marked as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing KEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

One KEP corresponds to one "feature" or "enhancement" for its whole lifecycle.
You do not need a new KEP to move from beta to GA, for example. If
new details emerge that belong in the KEP, edit the KEP. Once a feature has become
"implemented", major changes should get new KEPs.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md).

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable`, or significant changes once
it is marked `implementable`, must be approved by each of the KEP approvers.
If none of those approvers are still appropriate, then changes to that list
should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or
SIG Architecture for cross-cutting KEPs).

## Summary

Kubernetes uses feature gates for a wide variety of features. Unfortunately,
there are many problems and missing ablities with the current system (see
below). This KEP solves these problems. Since it is wide reaching, we break
implementation into several stages:

Stage 1:
* Add a Feature API
* Components report their use of the feature (i.e., how it is set on their
  command line)
* Add a control-plane enablement/disablement flow (example: clearing fields in
  etcd)

Stage 2:
* Add a cluster upgrade / downgrade flow beside the enablement flow (example:
  clearing a collection where the alpha and beta schemas are incompatible)
* For selected features, get the desired state from the API (it is set on
  apiserver's command line)

Stage 3:
* If opted in on apiserver's command line, a feature may be set dynamically in
  the API.

This functionality needs both stages 1 and 2 to proceed to beta or GA. Stage 3 is
optional but will be easy.

## Motivation

A list of problems:
* It's mostly unsafe to turn a feature on, use it, and turn it back off. This is
  because state stored while the feature was on is not cleaned up. So instead of
  going back into a pristine state, the cluster goes into a third state,
  on-with-dangling-references. This third state is tested less well than either
  the on or off states.
* Because of this, it's risky to try alpha features with important clusters.
* It's not very useful or convenient to make disposable clusters to try alpha
  features.
* Because of that, it's extremely hard to get robust feedback about features
  while they are in alpha and easy to change.
* There is no place in the code for devs to put turn on / turn off code, even if
  they wanted to.
* Likewise there is no place to put upgrade or downgrade code. Many efforts have
  used built-in resources instead of CRDs simply because there is no place to
  put CRD install code.
* It is difficult to know if a feature has been turned on for every relevant
  binary. Yes, there are metrics, but you have to know which binaries are
  relevant for what features and your particular cluster's metrics collection
  system.
* It is especially difficult to know if use of a feature at some point makes
  cluster upgrade unsafe now; for example, an alpha object being written while
  the feature was briefly on which is incompatable with the default-on beta.
* It is not easy to test the feature on -> use -> feature off lifecycle.

### Goals

Primary goals:
* Minimize codebase churn, existing feature authors do little-to-no work
* Expose the feature states in use in the cluster
* Make it possible to get the cluster back into the "off" state
* Expose the "off but dangling references / uses" state
* Make it easy to add enablement and disablement code
* Make it easy to add upgrade and downgrade code
* Make it easy to tell if it is not safe to upgrade / downgrade due to feature
  states
* A test ensures that feature on -> use -> feature off works for all features
  (i.e. it's easy for feature authors to be included in this test)

Secondary goals:
* Third parties should be able to use the API and libraries we build for their
  own features.
* Set feature states centrally (on apiserver command line) -- may not apply to
  all features
* Permit the platform admin to permit selected features to be dynamically
  settable, by api clients

Follow-up goals:
* When a feature is about a new field, remove it from OpenAPI specs when the
  feature is off.
* For features that possibly could support it, add a canarying mechanism so that
  the feature enablement doesn't break the whole cluster at once when there is a
  problem.

### Non-Goals

* The feature system will not permit passing configuration, since that's already
  done in a variety of ways today. Therefore only features that don't take
  config can be dynamic. Maybe this can be addressed in a follow up.

## Proposal

### High-level design

First we will discuss all the pieces with minimal detail. Probably this section
will leave you with questions which hopefully are answered in the "detailed
design" section.

#### Client Flow

Let's call the current use of feature gates the "client flow". Things that are
already handled correctly by the existing client flow we will try not to change.

The main thing we want to add to the client flow is reporting of the feature's
uses: did the client check the feature state, and what value did it find? The
necessity of this will be clear when we discuss the "server flow" later.

To make our improvements to the client flow, we will add a new implementation of
the existing k8s.io/component-base/featuregate package's MutableFeatureGate
type. It will require post-construction initialization, so that it can write the
uses to the api; to be a drop-in replacement, it can't require an api client
when it is constructed, because that happens before the command line is parsed /
config files are read.

Our new client will use the existing MutableFeatureGate to read the command
line, so perhaps it should be thought of as a layer.

When we update this KEP to solve the secondary goals, we will add here a
mechanism for reading feature on/off values from the API -- that's not easy, due
to the startup order.

#### API

Obviously, we will add an API object, Feature (details below). Features will be
namespaced; this will permit all Kubernetes features to be in the kube-system
namespace, and third parties can use another namespace.

The Feature object will record, per-feature, its configured desired value,
default value, uses, and current version. Most importantly, it will record the
current state of the feature. There will be at least four states: On, Off,
TurningOn, and TurningOff.

Various tasks might need to be performed before exiting a transitional state;
these will also be tracked in the API object.

It is the responsibility of the server flow to initiate and complete state
transitions.

#### Server flow

To explain what the server flow does, we will first assume for this overview
that all servers are at the same version. In Kubernetes, the server flow logic
will run in kube-apiserver. We will go through its responsibilities one at a
time.

Selecting a leader. Since multiple apiservers are running, we will pick one to
be the leader. We will use the apiserver identity feature to know the set of
apiservers. We will use a deterministic hashing mechanism to select the leader,
so that no additional traffic is necessary.

Announcing features. The server will create Feature objects about the features
it is aware of. If a Feature object exists for a feature the server doesn't know
about -- due to an upgrade or downgrade -- it will be preserved for a number of
versions.

Initiating state transitions. If the configured value for a feature (from the
command line) doesn't match the current Feature state, it will transition into
the corresponding transitional state (TurningOn or TurningOff). When this
happens, the server will assemble the list of tasks needed to complete the
transition. Since this is a distributed system and components can fail, this
list needs to be stored in the Feature.

What is a task and why do we need them?? Examples:
* Waiting for all uses of the feature to match the configured state. This needs
  to happen for every transition, so we will implement this -- no work needed
  from feature authors.
* Touch all objects in etcd to remove a field whose feature has been turned off.
  Only needed by features which are adding a field to some API object. We will
  have a place in the code to announce the need for the task, declare a function
  to perform the task, and we will run that function when needed. But the
  feature author will need to write the function to perform this operation.
* Suppose the feature is a new volume type; then a task might be to wait for
  volumes of that type to be removed for the system. It might be dangerous to
  automatically remove them. While they exist, we need the feature to stay in
  the TurningOff state.

Completing state transitions. When we evaluate a feature that is in a
transitional state and has tasks remaining, we attempt to perform the first
task. If it is successful, we remove it from the list. If that was the last
task, then we also change the feature state to the final state, On or Off.

Waiting for uses. This task examines the uses the client flow has written to the
object. Specifically, we clear the uses, wait a specified amount of time, and
see if any client checks in with the old value of the feature or not. Once no
client reports the old value, this task is complete.

### User Stories

Since the primary concerns with this proposal have been around whether it can
support existing features without requiring too much work from feature authors,
we will use this section to explain how several different features will work.

#### Story: MaxUnavailableStatefulSet

This feature adds a field to StatefulSet and logic in the controller.

When this feature is turned off, we would like to use the server flow logic
described above to remove any use of the field from api objects.

Additionally this feature could benefit from only needing to be turned on in one
place (apiserver command line) instead of also needing to be set on
controler-manager. (Secondary goals)

Additionally we should remove the field from the published schema if the feature
is off (follow-up goals).

#### Story: OpenAPIV3

This feature enables serving OpenAPI v3 spec documents in apiserver. It is
stateless and there is no work needed from the server flow.

It also affects only one binary (apiserver).

It is GA now, so this isn't a concern, but early in their lifecycle, low-impact
features like this would benefit from being dynamically settable, so cluster
admins without access to apiserver's command line could turn it on. (Secondary
goals)

#### Story: Feature which takes additional config on command line

TODO: find actual example

Feature X requires or permits additional command line flags. If these flags are
present when the feature isn't on, the binary fails to start. Therefore Feature
X and others like it are not good candidates for reading their desired state
live from the API, as this could cause the binary to be unable to start.

#### Story: New Volume Source type

Imagine a feature which permits creating volumes of a new type. When this
feature is turned off, we use a task in the server flow logic to hold the state
in the TurningOff state until all such volumes have been removed -- but we don't
do the removal, as that might be destructive. A cluster admin has to do the
removal(s) if they wish to complete the feature state transition.


### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

There are many existing features; the work will be structured such that all
existing features get the reporting half of this for free. If feature authors
want to use the server flow features, or enable centralized or dynamic feature
settings, they will need to opt-in by e.g. adding the feature to a TBD list.

### Risks and Mitigations

Some features are not well suited to centralized or dynamic enablement. We will
not force those features to work that way.

There could be bugs in the code. We will test it.

The server flow logic will be complex. We will make it easy for individual
feature authors to insert logic in the right places and we will write the
complex stuff wherever possible, especially if more than one feature could use
something.

Overall, the intention of this feature is to reduce risk around upgrades and
downgrades. If some part of this design fails to live up to that we will fix it
when it is pointed out.

## Design Details

TODO

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*
The goal is to ensure that we don't accept enhancements with inadequate testing.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[ ] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

<!--
Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.
-->

##### Unit tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.
-->

- `<package>`: `<date>` - `<test coverage>`

##### Integration tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html
-->

- <test>: <link to test coverage>

##### e2e tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html

We expect no non-infra related flakes in the last month as a GA graduation criteria.
-->

- <test>: <link to test coverage>

### Graduation Criteria

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, [feature gate] graduations, or as
something else. The KEP should keep this high-level with a focus on what
signals will be looked at to determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Feature gate][feature gate] lifecycle
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[feature gate]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### GA

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testing—e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

#### Deprecation

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag
-->

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and
  in the kubelet? How does an n-2 kubelet without this feature available behave
  when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
-->

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed and approved
for the KEP to move to `implementable` status and be included in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.
-->

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release.
-->

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

<!--
Pick one of these and delete the rest.

Documentation is available on [feature gate lifecycle] and expectations, as
well as the [existing list] of feature gates.

[feature gate lifecycle]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[existing list]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/
-->

- [ ] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name:
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
- [ ] Other
  - Describe the mechanism:
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
    plane?
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
    of a node?

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

<!--
Any change of default behavior may be surprising to users or break existing
automations, so be extremely careful here.
-->

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

<!--
Describe the consequences on existing workloads (e.g., if this is a runtime
feature, can it break the existing applications?).

Feature gates are typically disabled by setting the flag to `false` and
restarting the component. No other changes should be necessary to disable the
feature.

NOTE: Also set `disable-supported` to `true` or `false` in `kep.yaml`.
-->

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

<!--
The e2e framework does not currently support enabling or disabling feature
gates. However, unit tests in each component dealing with managing data, created
with and without the feature, are necessary. At the very least, think about
conversion tests if API types are being modified.

Additionally, for features that are introducing a new API field, unit tests that
are exercising the `switch` of feature gate itself (what happens if I disable a
feature gate after having objects written with the new field) are also critical.
You can take a look at one potential example of such test in:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97058/files#diff-7826f7adbc1996a05ab52e3f5f02429e94b68ce6bce0dc534d1be636154fded3R246-R282
-->

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.
-->

- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason: 
- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name: 
  - Other field: 
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.

  - Details:

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the following—thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->

### Scalability

<!--
For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them.

For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
Focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - Which API(s):
  - Estimated increase:
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

<!--
Look at the [existing SLIs/SLOs].

Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
(e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

<!--
Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
[supported limits].

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
-->

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

<!--
Focus not just on happy cases, but primarily on more pathological cases
(e.g. probes taking a minute instead of milliseconds, failed pods consuming resources, etc.).
If any of the resources can be exhausted, how this is mitigated with the existing limits
(e.g. pods per node) or new limits added by this KEP?

Are there any tests that were run/should be run to understand performance characteristics better
and validate the declared limits?
-->

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.
-->

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG. Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, or GitHub details. Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
