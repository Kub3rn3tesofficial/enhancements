## Summary

[ReferenceGrant](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/referencegrant/) was
developed by the [Gateway API subproject](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) to
enable certain object references to cross namespaces. More recently, it has also
been [used by
sig-storage](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/01/02/cross-namespace-data-sources-alpha/)
to enable cross-namespace data sources.

This KEP proposes moving ReferenceGrant from its current
`gateway.networking.k8s.io` API group into the `authorization.k8s.io` API
group.

## Motivation

Any project that wants to enable cross-namespace references currently has to choose
between introducing a dependency on Gateway API's ReferenceGrant or creating a
new API that would be partially redundant (leading to confusion for users).

Recent interest between SIGs has made it clear that ReferenceGrant is wanted for use
cases other than Gateway API. We would like to move ReferenceGrant to a neutral home
(ideally, under SIG Auth) in order to make it the canonical API for managing references
across namespaces.

### Goals

* Move ReferenceGrant to an API Group that SIG Auth manages
* Clearly define how ReferenceGrant should be used, including both current use
  cases and guidance for future use cases
* Implement a library to ensure that ReferenceGrant is implemented consistently
  by all controllers

### Non-Goals

* Develop an authorizer that will automatically implement ReferenceGrant for all
  use cases. (It would be impossible to represent concepts like "all namespaces"
  or label selectors that have become important for this KEP).

## Proposal

Move the existing ReferenceGrant resource into a new
`authorization.k8s.io` API group, defined within the Kubernetes code base
as part of the 1.27 release.

We will take this opportunity to clarify and update the API after SIG Auth
feedback. This resource will start with v1alpha1 as the API version.


### Risks and Mitigations

#### No Default Implementation
Similar to the Ingress and Gateway APIs, this API will be dependent on
implementations by controllers that are not included by default in Kubernetes.
This could lead to confusion for users. We'll need to rely heavily on
documentation for this feature, tracking all uses of official Kubernetes APIs
that support ReferenceGrant in a central place.

#### Potential for Variations Among Implementations
Because this relies on each individual controller to implement the logic,
it is possible that implementations may become inconsistent. To avoid that,
we'll provide a standard library for implementing ReferenceGrant. We'll
also strongly recommend that every API that relies on ReferenceGrant
includes robust conformance tests covering this functionality. Existing
Gateway API conformance tests can serve as a model for this.

#### Cross-Namespace References may Weaken Namespace Boundaries
Although we believe that the handshake required for cross-namespace references
with ReferenceGrant ensures these references will be safe, it does potentially
weaken existing namespace boundaries. We believe ReferenceGrant will have a net
benefit on the ecosystem as it will allow workloads, secrets, and configuration
to be deployed in separate namespaces that more clearly match up with desired
authorization.

## Design Details

### General Notes

#### `ReferenceGrant` is half of a handshake

When thinking about ReferenceGrant, it is important to remember that it does not
do anything by itself. It *Grants* the *possibility* of making a *Reference*
across namespaces. It's intended that _another object_ (that is, the From object)
complete the handshake by creating a reference to the referent object (the To
object).

#### ReferenceGrant authors must have sufficient access

Anyone creating or updating a ReferenceGrant MUST have read access to the
resources they are providing access to. If that authorization check fails, the
update or create action will also fail. ReferenceGrant is reserved for
referential and read only access. It MUST NOT be used to grant write access to a
resource in another namespace. In the future, we may consider adding support for
granting write access, but that is not in scope at this point.


#### Revocation behavior

Unfortunately, there's no way to be specific about what happens when a
ReferenceGrant is deleted in every possible case - the revocation behavior is
dependent on what access is being granted (and revoked). With that said, we
expect the following guidelines to be rules to apply to ALL implementations of
the API:

* Deletion of a ReferenceGrant means the granted access is revoked.
* ReferenceGrant controllers must remove any configuration generated by the
  granted access as soon as possible (eventual consistence permitting).
* Some actions that have already been enabled by the ReferenceGrant (such as
  forwarding requests or persisting data) cannot be undone, but no future
  actions should be allowed.

The examples below include information about what happens when the ReferenceGrant
is removed as data points.

### Example Usage

#### Gateway API Gateway Referencing Secret

In this example (from the Gateway API docs), we have a Gateway in the
`gateway-api-example-ns1` namespace, referencing a Secret in the
`gateway-api-example-ns2` namespace. The following ReferenceGrant allows this:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: cross-namespace-tls-gateway
  namespace: gateway-api-example-ns1
spec:
  gatewayClassName: acme-lb
  listeners:
  - name: https
    protocol: HTTPS
    port: 443
    hostname: "*.example.com"
    tls:
      # There's a Kind/Resource mismatch here, which sucks, but it is not
      # easily fixable, since Gateway is already a beta, close to GA
      # object.
      certificateRefs:
      - kind: Secret
        group: ""
        name: wildcard-example-com-cert
        namespace: gateway-api-example-ns2
---
apiVersion: authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ReferenceGrant
metadata:
  name: allow-ns1-gateways-to-ref-secrets
  namespace: gateway-api-example-ns2
from:
- group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
  resource: gateways
  namespace: gateway-api-example-ns1
to:
- group: ""
  resource: secrets
```

For Gateway TLS references, if this ReferenceGrant is deleted (revoking,
the grant), then the Listener will become invalid, and the configuration
will be removed as soon as possible (eventual consistency permitting).

#### Gateway API HTTPRoute Referencing Service

In this example, a HTTPRoute in the `baz` namespace is directing traffic
to a Service backend in the `quux` namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: quuxapp
  namespace: baz
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: example-gateway
    sectionName: https
  hostnames:
  - quux.example.com
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /
    # BackendRefs are Services by default.
    backendRefs:
    - name: quuxapp
      namespace: quux
      port: 80
---
apiVersion: authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ReferenceGrant
metadata:
  name: allow-baz-httproutes
  namespace: quux
from:
  namespace:
    name: baz
  resources:
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    resource: httproutes
to:
- group: ""
  resource: services
```

For HTTPRoute objects referencing a backend in another namespace, if the
ReferenceGrant is deleted, the backend will become invalid (since the target
can't be found). If there was more than one backend, then the valid parts of the
HTTPRoute's config would persist in the data plane.

But in this case, the cross-namespace reference is the _only_ backend, so the
removal of the ReferenceGrant will also result in the removal of the HTTPRoute's
config from the data plane.

#### PersistentVolumeClaim using cross namespace data source

This example is taken from https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/01/02/cross-namespace-data-sources-alpha/
and updated to use the proposed new spec.

It allows the PersistentVolumeClaim in the `dev` namespace to use a volume
snapshot from the `prod` namespace as its data source.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: example-pvc
  namespace: dev
spec:
  storageClassName: example
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  dataSourceRef:
    apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
    kind: VolumeSnapshot
    name: new-snapshot-demo
    namespace: prod
  volumeMode: Filesystem
---
apiVersion: authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ReferenceGrant
metadata:
  name: allow-prod-pvc
  namespace: prod
from:
- resource: persistentvolumeclaims
  namespace: dev
to:
- group: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
  resource: volumesnapshots
  name: new-snapshot-demo
```

When a ReferenceGrant is deleted, any existing volumes created from the
cross-namespace datasource will still persist, but new volumes will be
rejected".

### API Spec

```golang
// ReferenceGrant identifies kinds of resources in other namespaces that are
// trusted to reference the specified kinds of resources in the same namespace
// as the policy.
//
// Each ReferenceGrant can be used to represent a unique trust relationship.
// Additional ReferenceGrants can be used to add to the set of trusted
// sources of inbound references for the namespace they are defined within.
//
// ReferenceGrant is a form of runtime verification allowing users to assert
// which cross-namespace object references are permitted. Implementations that
// support ReferenceGrant MUST NOT permit cross-namespace references which have
// no grant, and MUST respond to the removal of a grant by revoking the access
// that the grant allowed.
//
// Implementation of ReferenceGrant is eventually consistent, dependent on
// watch events being received from the Kubernetes API. Although some processing
// delay is inevitable, any updates that could result in revocation of access MUST
// be considered high priority and handled as quickly as possible.
//
// Implementations of ReferenceGrant MUST treat all of the following scenarios
// as equivalent:
//
// * A reference to a Namespace that doesn't exist
// * A reference to a Namespace that exists and a Resource that doesn't exist
// * A reference to Namespace and Resource that exists but a ReferenceGrant
//   allowing the reference does not exist
//
// If any of the above occur, a generic error message such as "RefNotPermitted"
// should be communicated, likely via status on the referring resource.
//
// Support: Core

```

### Variations from Gateway API ReferenceGrant

This KEP makes several changes from the existing ReferenceGrant resource
defined by Gateway API:

#### 1. Removing Space for Status

Although we had theoretical use cases for status, they never materialized into
the Gateway API version of ReferenceGrant. [Earlier feedback on this
KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3767#discussion_r1084670421)
showed that we could use alternative approaches such as Events or new
"RefGranted" resources published by implementing controllers. Given that there
are both reasonable alternatives to status and we have not needed it so far, it
seems reasonable to leave out of this version of the API.

This means that `Spec` has been removed from the API, and `Spec.To` and
`Spec.From` have become top-level `To` and `From` fields.

#### 2. Kind -> Resource

In the original Gateway API implementation, we chose to use `Kind` rather than
`Resource`, mainly to improve the user experience. That is, it's easier users
to take the value from the `kind` field at the top of the YAML they are already
using, and put it straight into these fields, rather than needing to do a
kind-resource lookup for every user's interaction with the API. @robscott even
ended up making https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/5973 to clarify
the API conventions.

However, in discussion on this KEP, it's clear that the more generic nature of
_this_ API requires the additional specificity that `Resource` provides.

The Gateway API ReferenceGrant looked like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ReferenceGrant
metadata:
  name: allow-gateways
  namespace: bar
spec:
  from:
    # Note that in Gateway API, Group is currently defaulted
    # to this, which means you to explicitly set the group to
    # the empty string for Core resources. We should definitely
    # change this.
    - group: "gateway.networking.kubernetes.io"
      kind: Gateway
      namespace: foo
  to:
   - group: ""
     kind: Secret
```

The new version will look like this instead:
```yaml
apiVersion: authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ReferenceGrant
metadata:
  name: allow-gateways
  namespace: bar
from:
  # Assuming that we leave the default for Group to the empty
  # string, so that Core objects don't need additional config.
  - group: "gateway.networking.kubernetes.io"
    resource: gateways
    namespace: foo
to:
  - group: ""
    resource: secrets
```

The new version communicates the scope more clearly because `group`+`resource`
is unambiguous and corresponds to exactly one set of objects on the API Server.

This change also leaves room for an enhancement. Whether we have an in-tree or
CRD implementation, we can rely on the exact matching that the plural resource
name gives us, and [warn](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/03/warnings/) if
either side of the grant is for an API that's not served by this cluster.

#### 3. Verbs

A new "verbs" field will be added in response to [earlier
feedback](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3767#discussion_r1084509958)
on this KEP. This allows users to clearly communicate the intent of the
ReferenceGrant. This will be particularly useful if there's ever a kind of
resource that can make more than one kind of cross-namespace reference, or a
situation where the same resource could receive cross-namespace references for
different purposes.

We will initially define 3 well-known values here to represent the current use
cases of ReferenceGrant, and we will leave room for other custom domain-prefixed
values if this API is used for implementation-specific use cases in the future.

Future standard verbs will be approved by SIG Auth. In general, standard verbs
should be reserved for:

* References to and from official Kubernetes APIs
* Well defined use cases that will have conformance tests
* Concepts that will be broadly available in Kubernetes clusters

#### 4. Namespace Label Selectors
Namespace Label Selectors add significant complexity for both users and implementors of
this API. With that said, we believe they provide sufficient value to support as part
of this API. We will add a new `from.namespace` struct that allows specifying either a
name or a selector.

**Before Change:**
```yaml
apiVersion: authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ReferenceGrant
metadata:
  name: allow-baz-httproutes
  namespace: quux
from:
- namespace: baz
  group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
  resource: httproutes
to:
- group: ""
  resource: services
```

**After:**
```yaml
apiVersion: authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ReferenceGrant
metadata:
  name: allow-baz-httproutes
  namespace: quux
from:
  namespace:
    name: baz
  resources:
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    resource: httproutes
to:
- group: ""
  resource: services
```

This change was inspired by earlier feedback on the KEP:

* https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3767#discussion_r1084492070
* https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3767#discussion_r1084674648

### Additional Considerations

#### Using ReferenceGrant to Grant RBAC to Controllers

In the future it could be feasible for an authorization controller to watch
ReferenceGrants and create corresponding access to the implementing controller
RBAC. There are several significant challenges that have prevented us from
including that in this KEP:

1. There is not a reliable way to communicate which controllers a ReferenceGrant
   is providing access to. We would likely need another resource such as
   "ReferenceGrantee" that describes an identity and the resources it
   implements. This authorization controller could then automatically grant
   additional RBAC access based only on the ReferenceGrants.
2. This would be further complicated if we ever needed ReferenceGrants to grant
   more than just read access.
3. It would be rather complicated to write a controller that implemented this
   kind of very selective and rapidly changing level of access. We would need to
   provide some patterns and ideally shared library code to simplify this.

Although we want to reach this eventual goal, we believe it can be covered by future
additive work and does not need to block this specific KEP.

#### Alternative Names to "To" and "From"
Some early feedback on this KEP suggested looking at alternative field names for
"from" and "to":
https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3767#discussion_r1084671720

Although we agree that there may be better field names available, we
prefer moving forward with the existing "from" and "to" names because:

* no other alternatives have developed any kind of consensus
* the existing names have not been a source of confusion for existing
  ReferenceGrant usage

With that said, we'll list some of the alternatives below. First, names that
have been ruled out:

* subject/object - overly confusing
* subject/from - not as symmetric

Names that could potentially work:

* subject/referrer
* subject/origin

For reference, there was also an [earlier
discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-api-reviewers/c/ldmrXXQC4G4)
on the kubernetes-api-reviewers mailing list that's also relevant to this.


#### Potential Wildcard Selector Support

As suggested by
[early](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3767#discussion_r1086020464)
[feedback](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3767#discussion_r1086012665)
on this KEP, we could add support for all of the following:

1. References to any group or resource
1. References from any group or resource
1. References from any namespace

Note that we already allow `to.name` to be optional, we could update that to support
`*` instead. That would mean the following fields would support `*`:

* `from.namespace`
* `from.group`
* `from.resource`
* `to.group`
* `to.resource`
* `to.name`

That would allow a valid ReferenceGrant to look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ReferenceGrant
metadata:
  name: allow-backups
verbs:
  - "PopulateData"
from:
  - group: "*"
    resource: "*"
    namespace: "*"
to:
  - group: "*"
    resource: "*"
    name: "*"
```

Although we admit that some portion of this could be compelling, we do not
believe it needs to be added at this time. If needed, we can add support for
wildcard values in a future version of the API. Given that ReferenceGrants are
additive in nature, new ReferenceGrants with wildcard values could be added to a
cluster without breaking existing ReferenceGrant usage.

### Why Not Resource Label Selectors?

Although we have been convinced that namespace selectors could provide value
here, applying that same pattern to resources would come at significantly higher
implementation and UX cost and provide less value. Understanding and reacting to
changes on namespace labels is already well defined and in use in existing APIs
such as NetworkPolicy and Gateway API. If we were to expand that to support
labels on any resource type, the implementation complexity would exponentially
increase. It would also represent even more complexity that users had to keep
track of.

With that said, we are capturing previous discussion about this topic here for
future readers of this KEP:

Previous Discussions:
* https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3767#discussion_r1084492070
* https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3767#discussion_r1084674648

### Test Plan

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

This is a net new resource to Kubernetes so it will not require any changes or
additions to existing tests.

##### Unit tests

Unit tests will be used to cover:

1. ReferenceGrant validation
2. ReferenceGrant implementation library

Test Cases of the ReferenceGrant implementation library will cover the
following:

* A reference to a Namespace that doesn't exist
* A reference to a Namespace that exists and a Resource that doesn't exist
* A reference to a Namespace and Resource that exists but a ReferenceGrant
  allowing the reference does not exist
* Multiple entries in both from and to entries within a ReferenceGrant
* A ReferenceGrant that allows references to kinds of resources that do not
  exist
* Multiple ReferenceGrants with partially overlapping grants
* Revocation of a ReferenceGrant with partially overlapping grants
* A ReferenceGrant that does not specify `to.name`

More details will be added as the details of the implementation library are
clarified.

##### Integration tests

Before this graduates to beta, we will provide a reference implementation with a
sample CRD that will be used to provide integration tests.

##### e2e tests

We will strongly encourage every API that uses ReferenceGrant to define
conformance tests for their use of ReferenceGrant.

### Graduation Criteria

#### Beta

[ ] Reference implementation with integration tests.
[ ] Almost all of the fields and behavior have conformance test coverage in at least one project (for example Gateway API).

#### GA

[ ] Conformance tests that exercise all ReferenceGrant API calls (not the actual implementation of the API).
[ ] Multiple implementations of this API passing all relevant conformance tests.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

N/A

### Version Skew Strategy

Version skew is a bit different here. Although we will provide a shared library
for implementing this API, this will only be used by third-party controllers,
not built-in components.

There will be some implementations that support both the API defined by Gateway
API and this API. Since these resources are entirely additive and can be
duplicative, we can copy Gateway API resources to the new API group and delete
the old Gateway API resources as part of a seamless migration. We expect that
many implementations will provide this recommendation to users, and we may even
provide tooling to simplify this process.


## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Other
  - Describe the mechanism: Enable alpha ReferenceGrant API
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
    plane?
    No
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
    of a node? (Do not assume `Dynamic Kubelet Config` feature is enabled).
    No

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

The API would become accessible again, implementing controllers may need to be
restarted to pick up the presence of this API.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

No

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

API enablement may not work, but that would not be unique to this API.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

N/A, this is just an API

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

N/A, this is just an API

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

No

### Monitoring Requirements

N/A, this is just an API

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?
```
kubectl get referencegrants --all-namespaces
```

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

This will be dependent on the API that ReferenceGrant is used with. In Gateway API,
each resource has clear status conditions that reflect the validity of a cross-namespace
reference.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

Changes to ReferenceGrants are processed by the shared library within 10 seconds 99% over a quarter.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

Changes to ReferenceGrants are processed by the shared library within 10 seconds.

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

No

### Dependencies

N/A, this is just an API

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

- API Server

### Scalability

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

Yes, users may install controllers that watch for changes to ReferenceGrants.
Users may also create ReferenceGrants to enable cross-namespace references.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

API Type: ReferenceGrant
Supported Number of Objects per Cluster: No limit
Supported Number of Objects per Namespace: No limit

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

No

### Troubleshooting

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

The API would not be accessible. We would likely recommend that controllers revoke
cross-namespace references if they could not find ReferenceGrants that allow them
so this could result in a disruption for anything that relied on cross-namespace
references.

###### What are other known failure modes?

N/A, this is just an API

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

N/A, this is just an API

## Implementation History

* July 2021: [ReferencePolicy is proposed in Gateway API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/711)
* August 2021: [ReferencePolicy is added to Gateway API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+ReferencePolicy)
* June 2022: [ReferencePolicy is renamed to ReferenceGrant](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/1179)
* December 2022: [SIG-Storage uses ReferenceGrant for cross-namespace data storage sources](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/01/02/cross-namespace-data-sources-alpha/)
* December 2022: [ReferenceGrant graduates to beta in Gateway API v0.6.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v0.6.0)

## Drawbacks

N/A

## Alternatives

1. ReferenceGrant could remain as a CRD
This would probably be fine, we just don't really have a good place for it to
live. This could also complicate installation of Gateway API and other APIs that
depended on this.

2. Every API that wanted to support cross-namespace references could maintain their own version of ReferenceGrant
This would be a confusing mess, we should avoid this at all costs.
