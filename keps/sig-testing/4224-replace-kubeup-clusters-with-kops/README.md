**Note:** When your KEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [ ] **Pick a hosting SIG.**
  Make sure that the problem space is something the SIG is interested in taking
  up. KEPs should not be checked in without a sponsoring SIG.
- [ ] **Create an issue in kubernetes/enhancements**
  When filing an enhancement tracking issue, please make sure to complete all
  fields in that template. One of the fields asks for a link to the KEP. You
  can leave that blank until this KEP is filed, and then go back to the
  enhancement and add the link.
- [ ] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Copy this template into the owning SIG's directory and name it
  `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number (with no
  leading-zero padding) assigned to your enhancement above.
- [ ] **Fill out as much of the kep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Title", "Authors", "Owning-sig",
  "Status", and date-related fields.
- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections.
  These should be easy if you've preflighted the idea of the KEP with the
  appropriate SIG(s).
- [ ] **Create a PR for this KEP.**
  Assign it to people in the SIG who are sponsoring this process.
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the KEP clarified and merged quickly. The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

Just because a KEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved. Any KEP
marked as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing KEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

One KEP corresponds to one "feature" or "enhancement" for its whole lifecycle.
You do not need a new KEP to move from beta to GA, for example. If
new details emerge that belong in the KEP, edit the KEP. Once a feature has become
"implemented", major changes should get new KEPs.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md).

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable`, or significant changes once
it is marked `implementable`, must be approved by each of the KEP approvers.
If none of those approvers are still appropriate, then changes to that list
should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or
SIG Architecture for cross-cutting KEPs).

## Release Signoff Checklist

<!--
**ACTION REQUIRED:** In order to merge code into a release, there must be an
issue in [kubernetes/enhancements] referencing this KEP and targeting a release
milestone **before the [Enhancement Freeze](https://git.k8s.io/sig-release/releases)
of the targeted release**.

For enhancements that make changes to code or processes/procedures in core
Kubernetes—i.e., [kubernetes/kubernetes], we require the following Release
Signoff checklist to be completed.

Check these off as they are completed for the Release Team to track. These
checklist items _must_ be updated for the enhancement to be released.

## Summary

<!--
This section is incredibly important for producing high-quality, user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap. It should be
possible to collect this information before implementation begins, in order to
avoid requiring implementors to split their attention between writing release
notes and implementing the feature itself. KEP editors and SIG Docs
should help to ensure that the tone and content of the `Summary` section is
useful for a wide audience.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.

Both in this section and below, follow the guidelines of the [documentation
style guide]. In particular, wrap lines to a reasonable length, to make it
easier for reviewers to cite specific portions, and to minimize diff churn on
updates.

[documentation style guide]: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/style-guide.md
-->

Kubernetes 1.0 was released in July 2015 and since then, we have been using a collection of shell scripts in the cluster/ folder of the kubernetes/kubernetes repository to create Kubernetes clusters for e2e testing. These are called kube-up clusters and are deployed with fragile shell scripts that have caused many problems over the years. They have been deprecated for a long time and it is time to replace them with a different cluster provisioning tool.

Most of the Kubernetes e2e tests have to run on a real cluster on a cloud provider. The Kubernetes project has several 1st party tools that provision clusters on GCP such as kops, CAPI and kubespray. We could also reimplement kube-up in go.


## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this KEP.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users. The
motivation section can optionally provide links to [experience reports] to
demonstrate the interest in a KEP within the wider Kubernetes community.

[experience reports]: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports
-->

- The shell scripts are very fragile and no new features are being accepted
- arm64 testing needs to be done on GCE
- python and debian upgrades always break the Kubernetes e2e tests, particularly at a bad time(cutting releases, reverting/patching a critical bug). This will no longer be the case once we move to kops. For example, 
- We have some tests in kubernetes that make assumptions about a specific pieces of cloud infrastructure and are not a good fit for kubernetes e2e tests. Tests that rely on cloud-infra that are not reachable will be removed.


### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the KEP. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

- Replace kube-up clusters with kOps clusters for e2e testing
- Ensure all e2e tests can run successfully on the kops clusters and delete/rework tests as needed
- Delete tests that tested the bootstrap functionality of kube-up clusters. (Example: `Firewall rule should have correct firewall rules for e2e cluster`)


### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this KEP? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

- Stop testing kube-dns
- Cleanup addon-manager and related tests

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?.
The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

Replace kube-up clusters with kops clusters for e2e testing.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above?
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.
-->

N/A

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed, and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed, and by whom?

Consider including folks who also work outside the SIG or subproject.
-->

N/A

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

We'll create new prowjobs that use kops clusters to run cluster e2e testing. kops has been used for e2e testing for a long time but it runs a narrower set of tests designed for testing Kubernetes Distributions with various components.

### Test Plan and Graduation Criteria

This migration will be completed in phases:

- Phase One: Ensure that functionally identical canary job of the following periodic jobs are in-place by the end of 1.29 release and are GREEN.
   - RELEASE BLOCKING
      - ci-kubernetes-e2e-gci-gce
      - ci-kubernetes-e2e-gci-gce-reboot
      - ci-kubernetes-e2e-gci-gce-scalability
      - ci-kubernetes-e2e-ubuntu-gce-containerd
      - ci-kubernetes-gce-conformance-latest
      - ci-kubernetes-e2e-gce-master-new-gci-kubectl-skew
      - ci-kubernetes-e2e-gci-gce-alpha-features
    - RELEASE INFORMING
      - ci-kubernetes-e2e-gci-gce-serial
      - ci-kubernetes-e2e-gci-gce-slow
      - ci-kubernetes-e2e-gce-scale-performance
      - ci-kubernetes-e2e-gce-scale-correctness

arm64 is currently blocked by cloud-provider-gcp not having a published arm64 builds.

- Phase Two: Promote the canary jobs at the beginning of 1.30 release cycle and announce that kube-up clusters are deprecated and will be removed at the start of 1.33. Introduce canary presubmit jobs that use kops.

- Phase Three: Share with the sigs how to replace their own jobs and address any bugs for special jobs that have been raised by other sigs. Contributors have 3 and half release cycles to work with sig-testing on migrating kube-up clusters and addressing edge cases.

- Phase Four: Delete cluster/* folder once 1.33 release cycle starts

- Phase Five: Jobs that haven’t been migrated and are still using kube-up will fail and need to be either migrated or deleted from the project by test-freeze.

- Phase Six: Jobs that are still failing and using kube-up by test-freeze for 1.33 release will be deleted by sig-testing.

The jobs will be available under the [sig-cluster-lifecycle-kubeup-to-kops](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-cluster-lifecycle-kubeup-to-kops) testgrid dashboard.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->

Not applicable

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and nodes?
- How does an n-3 kubelet or kube-proxy without this feature available behave when this feature is used?
- How does an n-1 kube-controller-manager or kube-scheduler without this feature available behave when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
-->

Not applicable

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed and approved
for the KEP to move to `implementable` status and be included in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.
-->

Not applicable

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

Not Applicable


### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

This KEP depends on the following changes in:
- k/cloud-provider-gcp
  - images published for both architectures and promoted properly to registry.k8s.io
  - auth-provider-gcp to be published properly and available at artifacts.k8s.io
- k/kops
  - squash various bugs with kops

## Scalability

kops is already used to run scale tests on AWS. We can use it to replace the kube-up scale tests.

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

Not Applicable

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

No reason really.

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

We don't have one.

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG. Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, or GitHub details. Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
-->
