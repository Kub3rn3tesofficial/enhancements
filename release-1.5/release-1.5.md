(approved at Aug 25 community meeting)

#Proposed timeline
Kubernetes 1.4 is set to release on Sept 20.  We want to have another release of Kubernetes in the 2016 calendar year, so that means in December.

December tends to have a lot of vacation time towards the end, and we want to have a little buffer time in case of slips.  Late November also has the US Thanksgiving holiday, when many people will be on vacation.

The proposal below is identical in layout to the 1.4 plan, with the exceptions of:
- key days aren't Fridays, since it can be hard to end milestones right up against weekends
- a week is added for the bugfix period due to the Thanksgiving holiday
- KubeCon is Nov 8-9; Kubernetes Dev Summit - Nov 10

##1.5 Overview
- Sept 19 (Mon) coding start (7w)
- Nov 7 (Mon) feature complete, move to bugfix (5w, includes Thanksgiving)
- Dec 8 (Thurs) release

##1.5 Details

###Sept 19 - Nov 7
