## WARNING: etcd backup strongly recommended

Before updating to 1.6, you are strongly recommended to back up your etcd data.
Please consult the installation procedure you are using (kargo, kops, kube-up,
kube-aws, kubeadm etc) for specific advice.

1.6 encourages etcd3, and switching from etcd2 to etcd3 involves a full
migration of data between different storage engines.  You must stop the API
from writing to etcd during an etcd2 -> etcd3 migration.  HA installations cannot
be migrated at the current time using the official kubernetes procedure.

1.6 will also default to protobuf encoding if using etcd3.  **This change is
irreversible.**  To rollback, you must restore from a backup made before the
protobuf/etcd3 switch, and any changes since the backup will be lost.  As 1.5
does not support protobuf encoding, if you roll back to 1.5 after upgrading to
protobuf you will be forced to restore from backup, and you will lose any changes
since you converted to protobuf.  After conversion to protobuf, you should
validate the correct operation of your cluster thoroughly before returning it
to normal operation.

Backups are always a good precaution, particularly around upgrades, but this
upgrade has multiple known issues where the only remedy is to restore from
backup.

## Major updates and release themes

* Kubernetes now supports up to 5,000 nodes via etcd v3, which is enabled by default.
* [Role-based access control (RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io//docs/admin/authorization/rbac) has graduated to beta, and defines secure default roles for control plane, node, and controller components.
* The [`kubeadm` cluster bootstrap tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/) has graduated to beta. Some highlights:
  * All communication is now over TLS
  * Authorization plugins can be installed by kubeadm, including the new default of RBAC
  * The bootstrap token system now allows token management and expiration
* The [`kubefed` federation bootstrap tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/federation/set-up-cluster-federation-kubefed/) has also graduated to beta.
* Interaction with container runtimes is now through the CRI interface, enabling easier integration of runtimes with the kubelet. Docker remains the default runtime via Docker-CRI (which moves to beta).
* Various scheduling features have graduated to beta:
  * You can now use [multiple schedulers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/multiple-schedulers/)
  * [Nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/#node-affinity-beta-feature) and [pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity-beta-feature) now support affinity and anti-affinity
  * Advanced scheduling can be performed with [taints and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/#taints-and-tolerations-beta-feature)
* You can now specify (per pod) how long a pod should stay bound to a node, when there is a node problem. 
* Various storage features have graduated to GA:
  * StorageClass pre-installed and set as default on Azure, AWS, GCE, OpenStack, and vSphere
  * Configurable [Dynamic Provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/#dynamic) and [StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/#storageclasses)
* DaemonSets [can now be updated by a rolling update](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-daemon/update-daemon-set).

## Features and changes

Features for this release were tracked via the use of the [kubernetes/features](https://github.com/kubernetes/features) issues repo.  Each Feature issue is owned by a Special Interest Group from the [kubernetes/community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md).

## API Machinery
### Features
- **[stable]** The internal storage layer for kubernetes cluster state has been updated to use etcd v3 by default for new clusters.  Old clusters will have to plan for a data migration window. ([docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io/pull/2763))([kubernetes/features#44](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/44))
### Notable Changes
- Action is required (related to etcd v3):
	- upgrade to etcd3 prior to upgrading to 1.6 OR
	- explicitly specify `--storage-type=etcd2 --storage-media-type=application/json` when starting the apiserver

## Apps
### Features
- **[beta]** Introduce the rolling update feature for DaemonSet. See [Performing a Rolling Update on a DaemonSet](https://deploy-preview-2878--kubernetes-io-master-staging.netlify.com/docs/tasks/manage-daemon/update-daemon-set/).
- **[beta]** Deployments that cannot make progress in rolling out the newest version will now indicate via the API they are blocked ([docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/deployments/#deployment-status))
### Notable Changes
- Deployments that cannot make progress in rolling out the newest version will now indicate via the API they are blocked
- Deployment now fully respects ControllerRef to avoid fighting over Pods and ReplicaSets. At the time of upgrade, **you must not have Deployments with selectors that overlap**, or else [ownership of ReplicaSets may change](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/controller-ref.md#upgrading). ([#42175](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42175), [@enisoc](https://github.com/enisoc))
- StatefulSet now respects ControllerRef to avoid fighting over Pods. At the time of upgrade, **you must not have StatefulSets with selectors that overlap** with any other controllers (such as ReplicaSets), or else [ownership of Pods may change](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/controller-ref.md#upgrading). ([#42080](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42080), [@enisoc](https://github.com/enisoc))
- Add ready replicas in Deployments ([#37959](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/37959), [@kargakis](https://github.com/kargakis))
- ReplicaSet has onwer ref of the Deployment that created it ([#35676](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/35676), [@krmayankk](https://github.com/krmayankk))

## Auth
### Notable Changes
- 
- kube-up
 
- RBAC
- ABAC
- API additions

## Autoscaling
### Notable Changes
- **[alpha]** The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler now supports drawing metrics throug the API server aggregator.
- **[alpha]** The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler now supports scaling on multiple, custom metrics.

## Federation
### Features
- **[beta]** `kubefed` has graduated to beta: supports hosting federation on on-prem clusters, automatically configures `kube-dns` in joining clusters and allows passing arguments to federation components.

## Networking
### Notable Changes
* Adds support for configurable DNS stub domains and upstream nameservers to kube-dns.
  The following configuration options have been added to the `kube-system:kube-dns` ConfigMap:
  ```
  "stubDomains": {
    "acme.local": ["1.2.3.4"]
  },
  ```
  is a map of domain to list of nameservers for the domain. This is used
  to inject private DNS domains into the kube-dns namespace. In the above
  example, any DNS requests for *.acme.local will be served by the
  nameserver 1.2.3.4.
  ```
  "upstreamNameservers": ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]
  ```
  is a list of upstreamNameservers to use, overriding the configuration
  specified in /etc/resolv.conf.

* <a name="#CNIcompatdetails"></a>Container Network Interface ([CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni)) integration with Container
  Runtime Interface (CRI) is enabled by default.
  * The standard `bridge` plugin have been validated to interoperate with the new CRI + CNI code path.
  * If you are using plugins other than `bridge`, make sure you have updated custom plugins to the 
    latest version that is compatible.
  * If you encounter any issues involving CNI plugins, CRI can be disabled with setting the `--enable-cri`
    flag to `false`.
  * [Associated action required notes](#CNIcompat).
  
* An empty `kube-system:kube-dns` ConfigMap will be created for the cluster if one did not already exist.


## Scheduling
### Features
- **[alpha]** Represent node problems "not ready" and "unreachable" using `NoExecute` taints. In combination with `tolerationSeconds` described below, this allows per-pod specification of how long to remain bound to a node that becomes unreachable or not ready, rather than using the default of 5 minutes. You can enable this alpha feature by including `TaintBasedEvictions=true` in `--feature-gates`, such as `--feature-gates=FooBar=true,TaintBasedEvictions=true`. Documentation is [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/).
- **[beta]** The [multiple schedulers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/multiple-schedulers/). This feature allows you to run multiple schedulers in parallel, each responsible for different sets of pods. When using multiple schedulers, the scheduler name is now specified in a new-in-1.6 `schedulerName` field of the PodSpec rather than using the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/name` annotation on the Pod. When you upgrade to 1.6, the Kubernetes default scheduler will start using the `schedulerName` field of the PodSpec and will ignore the annotation. 
- **[beta]** [Node affinity/anti-affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/) and **[beta]** [pod affinity/anti-affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/). Node affinity/anti-affinity allow you to specify rules for restricting which node(s) a pod can schedule onto, based on the labels on the node. Pod affinity/anti-affinity allow you to specify rules for spreading and packing pods relative to one another, across arbitrary topologies (node, zone, etc.) These affinity rules are now be specified in a new-in-1.6 `affinity` field of the PodSpec. Kubernetes 1.6 continues to support the alpha `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/affinity` annotation on the Pod if you explicitly enable the alpha feature "AffinityInAnnotations", but it will be removed in a future release. When you upgrade to 1.6, if you have not enabled the alpha feature, then the scheduler will use the `affinity` field in PodSpec and will ignore the annotation. If you have enabled the alpha feature, then the scheduler will use the `affinity` field in PodSpec if it is present, and otherwise will use the annotation.
- **[beta]** [Taints and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/). This feature allows you to specify rules for "repelling" pods from nodes by default, which enables use cases like dedicated nodes and reserving nodes with special features for pods that need those features. We've also added a `NoExecute` taint type that evicts already-running pods, and an associated `tolerationSeconds` field to tolerations to delay the eviction for a specified amount of time. As before, taints are created using `kubectl taint` (but internally they are now represented as a field `taints` in the NodeSpec rather than using the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/taints` annotation on Node). Tolerations are now specified in a new-in-1.6 `tolerations` field of the PodSpec rather than using the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerations` annotation on the Pod. When you upgrade to 1.6, the scheduler will start using the fields and will ignore the annotations.

### Breaking Changes
The features described above are now specified using fields rather than annotations. As a result, you must take the following actions if you are already using any of the features (in their alpha form):
- **Multiple schedulers**
  - Modify your PodSpecs that currently use the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/name` annotation on Pod, to instead use the `schedulerName` field in the PodSpec.
  - Modify any custom scheduler(s) you have written so that they read the `schedulerName` field on Pod instead of the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/name` annotation. 
  - Note that you can only start using the `schedulerName` field **after** you upgrade to 1.6; it is not recognized in 1.5.

- **Node affinity/anti-affinity and pod affinity/anti-affinity**
  - You can continue to use the alpha version of this feature (with one caveat -- see below), in which you specify affinity requests using Pod annotations, in 1.6 by including `AffinityInAnnotations=true` in `--feature-gates`, such as `--feature-gates=FooBar=true,AffinityInAnnotations=true`. Otherwise, you must modify your PodSpecs that currently use the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/affinity` annotation on Pod, to instead use the `affinity` field in the PodSpec. Support for the annotation will be removed in a future release, so we encourage you to switch to using the field as soon as possible.
  - Caveat: The alpha version no longer supports, and the beta version does not support, the "empty `podAffinityTerm.namespaces` list means all namespaces" behavior. In both alpha and beta it now means "same namespace as the pod specifying this affinity rule."
  - Note that you can only start using the `affinity` field **after** you upgrade to 1.6; it is not recognized in 1.5.
  - The `--failure-domains` scheduler command line-argument is not supported in the beta vesion of the feature.

- **Taints**
  - You will need to use `kubectl taint` to re-create all of your taints after kubectl and the master are upgraded to 1.6. Between the time the master is upgraded to 1.6 and when you do this, your existing taints will have no effect. 
  - You can find out what taints you have in place on a node while you are still running Kubernetes 1.5 by doing `kubectl describe node <node name>`; the `Taints` section will show the taints you have in place. To see the taints that were created under 1.5 when you are running 1.6, do `kubectl get node <node name> -o yaml` and look for the "Annotation" section with the annotation key `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/taints`
  - You can remove the "old" taints (stored internally as annotations) at any time after the upgrade by doing `kubectl annotate nodes <node name> scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/taints-`
(note the minus at the end, which means "delete the taint with this key")
  - Note that because any taints you might have created with Kubernetes 1.5 can only affect the scheduling of new pods (the `NoExecute` taint effect is introduced in 1.6), neither the master upgrade nor your running `kubectl taint` to re-create the taints will affect pods that are already running.

- **Tolerations**
  - After your master is upgraded to 1.6, you will need to update your PodSpecs to set the `tolerations` field of the PodSpec and remove the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerations` annotation on the Pod. (It's not strictly necessary to remove the annotation, as it will have no effect once you upgrade to 1.6.) Between the time the master is upgraded to 1.6 and when you do this, tolerations attached to Pods that are created will have no effect. Pods that are already running will not be affected by the upgrade.
  - You can find the PodSpec tolerations that were created as annotations (if any) in a controller definition by doing `kubectl get <controller kind> <controller name> -o yaml` and looking for the "Annotation" section with the annotation key `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerations` (This will work whether you are running Kubernetes 1.5 or 1.6).
  - To update a controller's PodSpec to use the field instead of the annotation, use one of the kubectl commands that do update ("kubectl replace" or "kubectl apply" or "kubectl patch") or just delete the controller entirely and re-create it with a new pod template. Note that you will be able to do these things only after the upgrade.

## Service Catalog
### Features
- **[alpha]** Adds a new API resource `PodPreset` and admission controller to enable defining cross-cutting injection of Volumes and Environment into Pods.

[ to fix above ]

## Action Required

### kublet
* Hard eviction thresholds will be subtracted from the Allocatable capacity on nodes to improve node reliability. This *may* break existing clusters since the overall schedulable capacity would reduce after upgrading to v1.6. You can opt-out of this feature by specifying `--experimental-allocatable-ignore-eviction=true`.
* Fluentd was migrated to Daemon Set, which targets nodes with beta.kubernetes.io/fluentd-ds-ready=true label. If you use fluentd in your cluster please make sure that the nodes with version 1.6+ contains this label. ([#42931](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42931), [@piosz](https://github.com/piosz))

### Volumes
* StorageClass pre-installed and set as default on Azure, AWS, GCE, OpenStack, and vSphere.
  - This is something to pay close attention to if you’ve been using Kubernetes for a while, because it changes the default behavior of PersistentVolumeClaim objects on these clouds.
  - Marking a StorageClass as default makes it so that even a PersistentVolumeClaim without a StorageClass specified will trigger dynamic provisioning (instead of binding to an existing pool of PVs).
  - If you depend on the old behavior of volumes binding to existing pool of PersistentVolume objects then modify the StorageClass object and set `storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` to `false`.
* Flex volume plugin is updated to support attach/detach interfaces. It broke backward compatibility. Please update your drivers and implement the new callouts.  ([#41804](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41804), [@chakri-nelluri](https://github.com/chakri-nelluri))


## Notable Features

### kubeadm
* **[beta]** Introduces an API for clients to request TLS certificates from the API server. See the [tutorial](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster).
* **[beta]** kubeadm is enhanced and improved with a baseline feature set and command line flags that are now marked as beta. Other parts of kubeadm, including subcommands under `kubeadm alpha`, are [still in alpha](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubeadm/).  Using it is considered safe, although note that upgrades and HA are not yet supported. Please [try it out](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/) and [give us feedback](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/#feedback)!
* **[alpha]** New Bootstrap Token authentication and management method. Works well with kubeadm. kubeadm now supports managing tokens, including time based expiration, after the cluster is launched.  See [kubeadm reference docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubeadm/#manage-tokens) for details.
* **[alpha]** Adds a new cloud-controller-manager binary that may be used for testing the new out-of-core cloudprovider flow.

### kublet
* **[stable]** kubelet launches pods in a new cgroup hierarchy to better enforce quality of service.  Operators must drain all pods from their nodes prior to upgrade of the kubelet.  They must ensure the configured cgroup driver matches their associated container runtime cgroup driver.

### RBAC
* **[beta]** RBAC API is promoted to v1beta1 (rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1), and defines default roles for control plane, node, and controller components.
* **[beta]** The Docker-CRI implementation is Beta and is enabled by default in kubelet.  You can disable it by `--enable-cri=false`. See [notes on the new implementation]( https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/container-runtime-interface.md#kubernetes-v16-release-docker-cri-integration-beta) for more details.

### Volumes
* **[stable]** StorageClass API is promoted to v1 (storage.k8s.io/v1).
* **[stable]** Default storage classes are deployed during installation on Azure, AWS, GCE, OpenStack and vSphere.
* **[stable]** Added ability to populate environment variables from a configmap or secret.
* **[stable]** Support for user-written/run dynamic PV provisioners. The Kubernetes Incubator contains [a golang library and examples](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage).
* **[stable]** Volume plugin for ScaleIO enabling pods to seamlessly access and use data stored on Dell EMC ScaleIO volumes.
* **[stable]** Volume plugin for Portworx added capability to use [Portworx](http://www.portworx.com) as a storage provider for Kubernetes clusters. Portworx pools server capacity and turns servers or cloud instances into converged, highly available compute and storage nodes.
* **[stable]** Add support to use NFSv3, NFSv4, and GlusterFS on GCE/GKE GCI image based clusters.
* **[beta]** Added support for mount options in persistent volumes.
* **[alpha]** All in one volume proposal - a new volume driver capable of projecting secrets, configmaps, and downward API items into the same directory.
* **[alpha]** Flex volume API and Improved lifecycle (flexvolume).

## Deprications
* Remove extensions/v1beta1 Jobs resource, and job/v1beta1 generator. ([#38614](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38614), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh))

### Cluster Provisioning Scripts
* The bash AWS deployment via kube-up.sh has been deprecated. See http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/aws/ for alternatives. ([#38772](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38772), [@zmerlynn](https://github.com/zmerlynn))
* Remove Azure kube-up as the Azure community has focused efforts elsewhere. ([#41672](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41672), [@mikedanese](https://github.com/mikedanese))
* Remove the deprecated vsphere kube-up. ([#39140](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39140), [@kerneltime](https://github.com/kerneltime))

### Other Deprications
* Remove cmd/kube-discovery from the tree since it's not necessary anymore ([#42070](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42070), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))

#### kubeadm
* Quite a few flags been renamed or removed.  Those options that are removed as flags can still be accessed via the config file.  Most noteably this includes external etcd settings and the option for setting the cloud provider on the API server.  The [kubeadm reference documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubeadm/) is up to date with the new flags.

## Important Changes

### kubectl
* Running `kubectl taint` (alpha in 1.5) against a 1.6 server requires upgrading kubectl to version 1.6
* Running `kubectl taint` (alpha in 1.5) against a 1.5 server requires a kubectl version of 1.5
* Running `kubectl create secret` no longer accepts passing multiple values to a single --from-literal flag using comma separation
  * Update command invocations to pass separate --from-literal flags for each value



## Changes to API Resources
### ABAC
* ABAC policies using `"user":"*"` or `"group":"*"` to match all users or groups will only match authenticated requests. To match unauthenticated requests, ABAC policies must explicitly specify `"group":"system:unauthenticated"` ([#38968](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38968), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

### Admission Control
* Adds a new API resource `PodPreset` and admission controller to enable defining cross-cutting injection of Volumes and Environment into Pods. ([#41931](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41931), [@jessfraz](https://github.com/jessfraz))
* Enable DefaultTolerationSeconds admission controller by default ([#41815](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41815), [@kevin-wangzefeng](https://github.com/kevin-wangzefeng))
* ResourceQuota ability to support default limited resources ([#36765](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36765), [@derekwaynecarr](https://github.com/derekwaynecarr))
* Add defaultTolerationSeconds admission controller ([#41414](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41414), [@kevin-wangzefeng](https://github.com/kevin-wangzefeng))
* An `automountServiceAccountToken` field was added to ServiceAccount and PodSpec objects. If set to `false` on a pod spec, no service account token is automounted in the pod. If set to `false` on a service account, no service account token is automounted for that service account unless explicitly overridden in the pod spec. ([#37953](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/37953), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
* Admission control support for versioned configuration files ([#39109](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39109), [@derekwaynecarr](https://github.com/derekwaynecarr))
* Ability to quota storage by storage class ([#34554](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/34554), [@derekwaynecarr](https://github.com/derekwaynecarr))

### Authentication
* The authentication.k8s.io API group was promoted to v1([#41058](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41058), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

### Authorization
* The authorization.k8s.io API group was promoted to v1 ([#40709](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40709), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
* The SubjectAccessReview API now passes subresource and resource name information to the authorizer to answer authorization queries. ([#40935](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40935), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

### Autoscaling
* Introduces an new alpha version of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler including expanded support for specifying metrics. ([#36033](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36033), [@DirectXMan12](https://github.com/DirectXMan12))
* HorizontalPodAutoscaler is no longer supported in extensions/v1beta1 version. Use autoscaling/v1 instead. ([#35782](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/35782), [@piosz](https://github.com/piosz))
* Fixes an HPA-related panic due to division-by-zero. ([#39694](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39694), [@DirectXMan12](https://github.com/DirectXMan12))

### Certificates
* The CertificateSigningRequest API added the `extra` field to persist all information about the requesting user. This mirrors the fields in the SubjectAccessReview API used to check authorization. ([#41755](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41755), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
* Native support for token based bootstrap flow.  This includes signing a well known ConfigMap in the `kube-public` namespace and cleaning out expired tokens. ([#36101](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36101), [@jbeda](https://github.com/jbeda))

### Config Map
* Volumes and environment variables populated from ConfigMap and Secret objects can now tolerate the named source object or specific keys being missing, by adding `optional: true` to the volume or environment variable source specifications. ([#39981](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39981), [@fraenkel](https://github.com/fraenkel))
* Allow pods to define multiple environment variables from a whole ConfigMap ([#36245](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36245), [@fraenkel](https://github.com/fraenkel))

### CronJob
* Add configurable limits to CronJob resource to specify how many successful and failed jobs are preserved. ([#40932](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40932), [@peay](https://github.com/peay))

### Daemon Set
* DaemonSet now respects ControllerRef to avoid fighting over Pods. ([#42173](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42173), [@enisoc](https://github.com/enisoc))
* Make DaemonSet respect critical pods annotation when scheduling.  ([#42028](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42028), [@janetkuo](https://github.com/janetkuo))
* Implement the update feature for DaemonSet. ([#41116](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41116), [@lukaszo](https://github.com/lukaszo))
* Make DaemonSets survive taint-based evictions when nodes turn unreachable/notReady. ([#41896](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41896), [@kevin-wangzefeng](https://github.com/kevin-wangzefeng))
* Make DaemonSet controller respect node taints and pod tolerations.  ([#41172](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41172), [@janetkuo](https://github.com/janetkuo))
* DaemonSet controller actively kills failed pods (to recreate them) ([#40330](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40330), [@janetkuo](https://github.com/janetkuo))
* DaemonSet ObservedGeneration ([#39157](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39157), [@lukaszo](https://github.com/lukaszo))

### Deployments
* Add ready replicas in Deployments ([#37959](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/37959), [@kargakis](https://github.com/kargakis))
* Introduce apps/v1beta1.Deployments resource with modified defaults compared to extensions/v1beta1.Deployments. ([#39683](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39683), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh))
* Introduce new generator for apps/v1beta1 deployments ([#42362](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42362), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh))

### Pod
* Init containers have graduated to GA and now appear as a field.  The beta annotation value will still be respected and overrides the field value. ([#38382](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38382), [@hodovska](https://github.com/hodovska))
* A new field `terminationMessagePolicy` has been added to containers that allows a user to request `FallbackToLogsOnError`, which will read from the container's logs to populate the termination message if the user does not write to the termination message log file.  The termination message file is now properly readable for end users and has a maximum size (4k bytes) to prevent abuse.  Each pod may have up to 12k bytes of termination messages before the contents of each will be truncated. ([#39341](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39341), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))
* Fix issue with PodDisruptionBudgets in which `minAvailable` specified as a percentage did not work with StatefulSet Pods. ([#39454](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39454), [@foxish](https://github.com/foxish))
* Node affinity has moved from annotations to api fields in the pod spec.  Node affinity that is defined in the annotations will be ignored. ([#37299](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/37299), [@rrati](https://github.com/rrati))
* Moved pod affinity and anti-affinity from annotations to api fields [#25319](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/25319) ([#39478](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39478), [@rrati](https://github.com/rrati))
* Add QoS pod status field ([#37968](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/37968), [@sjenning](https://github.com/sjenning))

### Pod Security Policy
* PodSecurityPolicy resource is now enabled by default in the extensions API group. ([#39743](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39743), [@pweil-](https://github.com/pweil-))

### RBAC
* Default ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding objects are automatically updated at server start to add missing permissions and subjects (extra permissions and subjects are left in place). To prevent autoupdating a particular role or rolebinding, annotate it with `rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate=false`. ([#41155](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41155), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
* `v1beta1` RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding subjects changed `apiVersion` to `apiGroup` to fully-qualify a subject. ServiceAccount subjects default to an apiGroup of `""`, User and Group subjects default to an apiGroup of `"rbac.authorization.k8s.io"`. ([#41184](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41184), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
* the `attributeRestrictions` field has been removed from the PolicyRule type in the rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1 API. The field was not used by the RBAC authorizer. ([#39625](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39625), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k))
* A user can now be authorized to bind a particular role by having permission to perform the `bind` verb on the referenced role ([#39383](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39383), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
* To create or update an RBAC RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding object, a user must: ([#39383](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39383), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
    * 1. Be authorized to make the create or update API request
    * 2. Be allowed to bind the referenced role, either by already having all of the permissions contained in the referenced role, or by having the "bind" permission on the referenced role.
* The `--authorization-rbac-super-user` flag (alpha in 1.5) is deprecated; the `system:masters` group has privileged access ([#38121](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38121), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k))
* special handling of the user `*` in RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding objects is removed in v1beta1. To match all users, explicitly bind to the group `system:authenticated` and/or `system:unauthenticated`. Existing v1alpha1 bindings to the user `*` are automatically converted to the group `system:authenticated`. ([#38981](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38981), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

### Replica Set
* ReplicaSet has onwer ref of the Deployment that created it ([#35676](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/35676), [@krmayankk](https://github.com/krmayankk))

### Secrets
* Populate environment variables from a secrets. ([#39446](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39446), [@fraenkel](https://github.com/fraenkel))
* Added a new secret type "bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token" for dynamically creating TLS bootstrapping bearer tokens. ([#41281](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41281), [@ericchiang](https://github.com/ericchiang))

### Service
* Endpoints, that tolerate unready Pods, are now listing Pods in state Terminating as well ([#37093](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/37093), [@simonswine](https://github.com/simonswine))
* Fix Service Update on LoadBalancerSourceRanges Field ([#37720](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/37720), [@freehan](https://github.com/freehan))
* Bug fix. Incoming UDP packets not reach newly deployed services ([#32561](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/32561), [@zreigz](https://github.com/zreigz))

### Stateful Set

* Fix zone placement heuristics so that multiple mounts in a StatefulSet pod are created in the same zone ([#40910](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40910), [@justinsb](https://github.com/justinsb))
* Fixes issue [#38418](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38418) which, under circumstance, could cause StatefulSet to deadlock.  ([#40838](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40838), [@kow3ns](https://github.com/kow3ns))
  * Mediates issue [#36859](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36859). StatefulSet only acts on Pods whose identity matches the StatefulSet, providing a partial mediation for overlapping controllers.

### Taints and Tolerations
* Add a manager to NodeController that is responsible for removing Pods from Nodes tainted with NoExecute Taints. This feature is beta (as the rest of taints) and enabled by default. It's gated by controller-manager enable-taint-manager flag. ([#40355](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40355), [@gmarek](https://github.com/gmarek))
* Add an alpha feature that makes NodeController set Taints instead of deleting Pods from not Ready Nodes. ([#41133](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41133), [@gmarek](https://github.com/gmarek))
* Make tolerations respect wildcard key ([#39914](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39914), [@kevin-wangzefeng](https://github.com/kevin-wangzefeng))
* Forgiveness alpha version api definition ([#39469](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39469), [@kevin-wangzefeng](https://github.com/kevin-wangzefeng))

### Volumes
* StorageClassName attribute has been added to PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim objects and should be used instead of annotation `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class`. The beta annotation is still working in this release, however it will be removed in a future release. ([#42128](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42128), [@jsafrane](https://github.com/jsafrane))
* Parameter keys in a StorageClass `parameters` map may not use the `kubernetes.io` or `k8s.io` namespaces. ([#41837](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41837), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
* Add storage.k8s.io/v1 API ([#40088](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40088), [@jsafrane](https://github.com/jsafrane))
* Alpha version of dynamic volume provisioning is removed in this release. Annotation ([#40000](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40000), [@jsafrane](https://github.com/jsafrane))
    * "volume.alpha.kubernetes.io/storage-class" does not have any special meaning. A default storage class
    * and  DefaultStorageClass admission plugin can be used to preserve similar behavior of Kubernetes cluster,
    * see https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/#class-1 for details.
* Reduce verbosity of volume reconciler when attaching volumes ([#36900](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36900), [@codablock](https://github.com/codablock))

## Changes to Major Components

Please checkout the [user doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/abstractions/controllers/garbage-collection/) for details. ([#38676](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38676), [@caesarxuchao](https://github.com/caesarxuchao))
  * deleteOptions.orphanDependents is going to be deprecated in 1.7. Please use deleteOptions.propagationPolicy instead.

### kubeadm
* **A new label and taint is used for marking the master. The label is `node-role.kubernetes.io/master=""` and the taint has the effect `NoSchedule`. If you want to schedule a workload one the master (a networking DaemonSet for example), you must tolerate the `node-role.kubernetes.io/master="":NoSchedule` taint**
* **The kubelet API is now secured, only cluster admins are allowed to access it.**
* **Insecure access to the API Server over `localhost:8080` is now disabled.**
* **The control plane components now talk securely to each other. The API Server talks securely to the kubelets in the cluster.**
* **kubeadm creates RBAC-enabled clusters. This means that some add-ons which worked previously won't work without having their YAML configuration updated. Please see each vendor's own documentation to check that the add-ons you are using will work with Kubernetes 1.6.**
* **The kube-discovery Deployment isn't used anymore when creating a kubeadm cluster and shouldn't be used anywhere else either due to its insecure nature.**
* **The Certificates API has graduated from alpha to beta. This is a backwards-incompatible change since the alpha support is dropped, and therefore kubeadm v1.5 and v1.6 don't work together (for example kubeadm v1.5 can't join a kubeadm v1.6 cluster).**
* **Supporting only etcd3, with 3.0.14 as the minimum version.**
* **`kubeadm reset` will no longer drain nodes automatically.  This is because the credentials on nodes do not have permission to perform this operation.  We have documented an [alternate procedure](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/#tear-down), driven from the API server/master.**
* Hook up kubeadm against the BootstrapSigner ([#41417](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41417), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))
* Rename some flags for beta UI and fixup some logic ([#42064](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42064), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))
* Insecure access to the API Server at localhost:8080 will be turned off in v1.6 when using kubeadm ([#42066](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42066), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))
* Flag --use-kubernetes-version for kubeadm init renamed to --kubernetes-version ([#41820](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41820), [@kad](https://github.com/kad))
* Remove the --cloud-provider flag for beta init UX ([#41710](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41710), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))
* Fixed an SELinux issue in kubeadm on Docker 1.12+ by moving etcd SELinux options from container to pod. ([#40682](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40682), [@dgoodwin](https://github.com/dgoodwin))
* Add authorization mode to kubeadm ([#39846](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39846), [@andrewrynhard](https://github.com/andrewrynhard))
* Refactor the certificate and kubeconfig code in the kubeadm binary into two phases ([#39280](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39280), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))
* Added kubeadm commands to manage bootstrap tokens and the duration they are valid for. ([#35805](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/35805), [@dgoodwin](https://github.com/dgoodwin))

* Begin paths for internationalization in kubectl ([#36802](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36802), [@brendandburns](https://github.com/brendandburns))
  * Add initial french translations for kubectl ([#40645](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40645), [@brendandburns](https://github.com/brendandburns))

#### Updates to apply 
* New command `apply set-last-applied` *updates the applied-applied-configuration annotation* ([#41694](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41694), [@shiywang](https://github.com/shiywang))
* New command `apply view-last-applied` *command for viewing the last configuration file applied* ([#41146](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41146), [@shiywang](https://github.com/shiywang))
* `apply` now supports explicitly clearing values by setting them to null ([#40630](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40630), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
* Warn user when using `apply` on a resource lacking the `LastAppliedConfig` annotation ([#36672](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36672), [@ymqytw](https://github.com/ymqytw))
* PATCH (i.e. apply and edit) now supports merging lists of primitives ([#38665](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38665), [@ymqytw](https://github.com/ymqytw))
* `apply` falls back to generic 3-way JSON merge patch for Third Party Resource or unregistered types ([#40666](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40666), [@ymqytw](https://github.com/ymqytw))

#### Updates to edit
* `edit` now supports Third party resources and extension API servers. ([#41304](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41304), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
  * Now to edit a particular API version, provide the fully-qualify the resource, version, and group used to fetch the object (for example, `job.v1.batch/myjob`)
  * Client-side conversion is no longer done, and the `--output-version` option is deprecated for `kubectl edit`.
* `edit` works as intended with apply and will not change the annotation
  * No longer updates the last-applied-configuration annotation when --save-config is unspecified or false. ([#41924](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41924), [@ymqytw](https://github.com/ymqytw))
  * Fixes issue that caused apply to revert changes made by edit

#### Other Notable Changes
* The api server will publish the extensions/Deployments API as preferred over the apps/Deployment (introduced in 1.6). ([#43553](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43553), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
  * This will ensure certain commands in 1.5 versions of kubectl continue function when run against a 1.6 server. (e.g. `kubectl edit deployment`) 
* Taint
  * The `taint` command will not function in a skewed 1.5 / 1.6 environment - client and server versions must match (See Action required section above)
  * Change taints/tolerations to api fields ([#38957](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38957), [@aveshagarwal](https://github.com/aveshagarwal))
  * Make kubectl taint command respect effect NoExecute ([#42120](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42120), [@kevin-wangzefeng](https://github.com/kevin-wangzefeng))
* Allow drain --force to remove pods whose managing resource is deleted. ([#41864](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41864), [@marun](https://github.com/marun))
* `--output-version` is ignored for all commands except `kubectl convert`.  This is consistent with the generic nature of `kubectl` CRUD commands and the previous removal of `--api-version`.  Specific versions can be specified in the resource field: `resource.version.group`, `jobs.v1.batch`. ([#41576](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41576), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k))
* Allow missing keys in templates by default ([#39486](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39486), [@ncdc](https://github.com/ncdc))
* Add error message when trying to use clusterrole with namespace in kubectl ([#36424](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36424), [@xilabao](https://github.com/xilabao))
* When deleting an object with `--grace-period=0`, the client will begin a graceful deletion and wait until the resource is fully deleted.  To force deletion, use the `--force` flag. ([#37263](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/37263), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))

#### Bug fixes
* Fixed --save-config in create subcommand to save the annotation ([#40289](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40289), [@xilabao](https://github.com/xilabao))
* Fixed an issue where 'kubectl get --sort-by=' would return an error if the specified fields in sort were not specified in one or more of the returned objects. ([#40541](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40541), [@fabianofranz](https://github.com/fabianofranz))
  * Previously this would cause the command to fail regardless of whether or not the field was present in the object model
  * Now the command will succeed even if the sort-by field is missing from one or more of the objects
* Fixed issue with kubectl proxy so it will now proxy an empty path - e.g. http://localhost:8001 ([#39226](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39226), [@luksa](https://github.com/luksa))
* Fixed an issue where commas were not accepted in --from-literal flags for the creation of secrets. ([#35191](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/35191), [@SamiHiltunen](https://github.com/SamiHiltunen))
  * Passing multiple values separated by a comma in a single --from-literal flag is no longer supported. Please use multiple --from-literal flags to provide multiple values. 
* Fixed a bug where the --server, --token, and --certificate-authority flags were not overriding the related in-cluster configs when provided in a `kubectl` call inside a cluster. ([#39006](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39006), [@fabianofranz](https://github.com/fabianofranz))
